</div>

<p>In view of the many phases and complications involved in
the labor question, along with the cosmopolitan element engaged
in forcing, as it were, measures intended to revolutionize labor,
trade and commerce, this subject becomes of extreme delicacy
to treat, the intricacy of which affect all classes and conditions
of men, and threatens to convulse society from the outer crust
of uppertendom to the inner sub-strata of human interest, affecting
largely the social, civil, and political interests of the ever-enlarging
generations of mankind.</p>

<p>The dark cloud standing out in bold relief outlined against
the political horizon of this great republic seems to be gathering
in intensity. Just now the lull in matters pertaining to
this great question of CAPITAL and LABOR, seem like the
&ldquo;calm that precedes the hurricane.&rdquo; Animosities and antagonisms
are widening the gulf between these conflicting interests of
society, and anarchy and socialism, assuming a belligerent attitude,
threaten a disruption of good and wholesome government.</p>

<p>We bid a hearty God-speed to any innovation upon the stereotyped
and superannuated system, or dogmatic usage in the
interests of absolute and overwhelming monopolies, which has
for its object the general well-being of our common humanity,
the elevation of the universal brotherhood of mankind, and the
perpetuity of American institutions.</p>

<p>We do not believe in monopoly and oppression; but the
final triumph of right over wrong by honest, earnest and persevering
endeavor.</p>

<h3>SOCIALISM.</h3>

<p>A theory of society which advocates a more precise,
orderly and harmonious arrangement of the social relations
of mankind than that which has hitherto prevailed.&mdash;<cite>Webster.</cite>
</p>

<h3>COMMUNISM.</h3>

<p>The reorganizing of society, or the doctrine that it should be
reorganized, by regulating property, industry and the means of
livelihood, and also the domestic relations and social morals of
mankind; socialism; especially the doctrine of a community of property,
or the negative of individual right in property.&mdash;<cite>J. H.
Burton.</cite></p>

<h3>ANARCHY.</h3>

<p>Want of government, the state of society where there is no law or
supreme power, or where the laws are not efficient, and individuals do
what they please with impunity.&mdash;<cite>Webster.</cite></p>

   <p class="chapsum">&ldquo;Order, heaven&rsquo;s first law.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Never before, perhaps, in the history of any great nation, was
there a time when wise, honest and unswerving men were
necessary at the helm of the great social and political ship of
American freedom than at the present time, in order that she
may weather the blasts, pass in safety the dangerous reefs and
shoals of any <em>party politics</em>, maintain the majesty of her laws,
grow strong in truth, making aggressive warfare upon error
and superstition, &ldquo;and having done all to stand entire at last,&rdquo;
&ldquo;with her lamps trimmed and burning,&rdquo; her liberty enlightening
the world.</p>

<p>One of our great minds has said: &ldquo;Our country, though
rich in men of faithfulness and power, and having escaped from
the difficulties of earlier times, perceives new questions which
demand whatever of counsel the wise and thoughtful can give,&rdquo;
for an era so active in thought and impulse is always perilous
to the nation and need strong men, wise and calm in the midst
of her greatest storms. Many of our nation&rsquo;s noblest sons
within a short space of time have bowed in obedience to the
behest of that monarch whose summons all must obey. In our
minds we go back to that period when our country was young,
and behold manly forms, marked by intellectual dignity, and
bearing in their countenance the unmistakable insignia of true
and noble manhood. They, too, have passed away, and home
and sanctuary know them no more; but the light found in such

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">Pg&nbsp;10</a></span>

characters assist in solving the difficult problems of to-day. Our
nation&rsquo;s God can make of a poor and humble craftsman a
mighty statesman. Many such lives are poured full of honors,
and their graves are fresh and green in our memories. Nothing
can equal in grandeur the interminable extent of our vast
prairies, covered with blossoming buds. Every lover of nature,
and home and country can daily hear a grand anthem of praise
ascend to God for the munificence of his unspeakable gifts.</p>

<div class="poem">

      <span class="i0">&ldquo;From that cathedral boundless as our wonder<br /></span>
      <span class="i0">
         Whose quenchless lamps the sun and moon supply.&rdquo;<br />
      </span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>These pastoral symphonies are dear to all our hearts. We love our
country, and gazing upon our glorious flag, we feel it means to</p>

<div class="poem">
   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">&ldquo;<em>Friends a starry sky</em>,&rdquo;<br /></span>

   <div class="stanza">
      <span class="i0">&ldquo;<em>A storm in every fold.</em>&rdquo;<br /></span>
   </div>
</div>

<p>Untarnished its honor, and the undimmed radiance streaming
down from every star upon our glorious banner for over one
hundred years, what usurper dare insult her national prowess
and trail her honors in the dust, or flaunt the red flag of
anarchy and socialism in the face of our national greatness?</p>

<p>Anarchy cannot prevail, as &ldquo;order is heaven&rsquo;s first law,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;eternal vigilance the price of liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our measureless prosperity as a nation have caused to seek
employment, protection and a home beneath the ample folds of
our grand old flag, many representatives from almost every
nation under the sun, to whom have been extended all the
rights, social, civil, religious and political, of free-born American
citizenship, while obedient to its laws. We who seek this
country as our home, because of its advantages and the superior

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">Pg&nbsp;11</a></span>

facilities for obtaining a livelihood or of amassing wealth, can
be guilty of no baser act than to endeavor to sow the seeds of
discord and confusion among the peaceful and well organized
brotherhood in this land of freedom and prosperity; and all
violations of good and wholesome law, endangering the peace
and prosperity of citizens, or the overthrow of our national
institutions, are deserving of the nation&rsquo;s frown.</p>

<p>What greater insult can be offered to the children of freedom
than for people of foreign birth to usurp the birthrights
and trample upon the institutions for which their fathers bled
and died?</p>

<p>Never before were citizens of any country placed on trial for
so grave and flagrant a transgression, who received such consideration
and fairness at the hands of the administrators of law
and justice as did the participants in the Haymarket tragedy.</p>

<p>In view of the deep turpitude of their crime great credit is
due to all the standard papers of the city of Chicago, and the
Press of the United States, for the fair and impartial manner
in which they represented the Anarchists&rsquo; case during the trial
and pending the execution. The articles appearing from time
to time in their columns seemed ever tempered with mercy.
Yet firmness characterized all their expressed opinions. The
institutions of our country are dear to every true and loyal
American.</p>

<p>The outrage perpetrated upon our high order of civilization
called for life in exchange for the lives sacrificed by the tragic
events of the night of May the 4th, 1886. Every right-thinking
journalist acknowledged the justice of the sentence and
said, so let it be; believing that when &ldquo;judgment and justice
are abroad in the land the people will learn righteousness.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="chapsum">Anarchists&mdash;Their Nationality&mdash;The
   First Agitation&mdash;Leaders&mdash;Anarchy&mdash;The
   &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; Circular&mdash;The Haymarket
   Meeting&mdash;The Massacre.</p>
</div>

<p>Scarcely has the chronicler of time recorded fifty years in the
eventful history of Chicago since it was known only as a little
trading post for the Indians of the west and northwest, but being
the central and distributing point for the interminable
fertile territories stretching away toward the land of the setting
sun, its progress in wealth and population has been unprecedented.
The superior facilities for obtaining supplies, and the
demand for implements for agricultural purposes, have conspired
to render Chicago one of the most important commercial cities
on the globe. And to-day it stands the grainery of the American
Continent, the great repository and commercial reservoir of
continental America, with a cosmopolitan population of over
seven hundred thousand. Capitalists engaged in mammoth
manufacturing enterprises like McCormick and others, in order
to secure cheap labor to the exclusion of native skilled workmen,
have imported to this country thousands of foreigners who,
after gaining a foothold in the land, have turned upon their employers
in organized bands with measures intended to be revolutionary.</p>

<p>The troublesome element consisted largely of the ignorant
lower classes of Bavarians, Bohemians, Hungarians, Germans,
Austrians, and others who held secret meetings in organized
groups armed and equipped like the nihilists of Russia, and the
communists of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">Pg&nbsp;13</a></span></p>

<p>They called themselves socialists. Their emblem was <em>red</em>.
They paraded the streets of Chicago without let or hindrance
in 1878, carrying a red flag and making insulting and incendiary
speeches at Lake front park, and at several of the public halls
of the city.</p>

<p>This free country accorded to them without regard to birth
or nationality the rights of freedom of speech, and we shall
see how that indulgence beyond the bounds of propriety has
been abused. In 1877 they held secret meetings to organize
their forces, and during the same year there were several labor
riots.</p>

<p>In 1879 anarchists and socialists united to endeavor to secure
by their votes and influence as mayor <span class="smcap">Dr.
Ernst Schmidt</span>, and as city treasurer <span class="smcap">F.
Stauber</span>. Polling nearly 10,000 votes they secured several
representatives in the city council.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 2d of July, 1879, Captain Bielfeld, with
ten of the gang known as the Lehr and Werh Verein, left Turner Hall,
marching from Twelfth to Union, then returning, Lieut. Callahan secured
their arrest. As a test case for a violation of the law relative to
the militia, Bielfeld alone was booked to appear before the police
court on the 3d of July, <del>18.9</del><ins>1879</ins>. Rubens, his
attorney, gave bonds for his appearance. The defendant then took a
change of venue to Morrison, becoming his own bail to appear at that
place in the afternoon. Bielfeld, with his attorney, and prosecuting
attorney Cameron, were present. The case was continued for one week.
The following day being the Fourth of July, was looked forward to
with solicitude as a day when Chicago might expect riot and carnage.
Bielfeld had been bound in $300 bonds but was released on habeas corpus
the same day on an application to Judge Barnum, who

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">Pg&nbsp;14</a></span>

pronounced the majority of the clauses in the militia law as
unconstitutional.</p>

<p>In November, 1879, a similar case was argued before the
supreme court which in its rulings sustained the constitutionality
of the militia law in direct opposition to Judge Barnum&rsquo;s
rulings and opinions. This opinion was a reversing of Judge
Barnum&rsquo;s decision restricting armed bodies of socialists, anarchists,
or communists from parading the streets, deciding that in
matters pertaining to the peace and safety of citizens the police
powers are plenary.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1879 the Bohemian anarchistic agitators held
a picnic at Silver Leaf Grove, in the vicinity of Douglas Park,
and being annoyed by uninvited guests, at the command of their
captain, Prokop Hudek, they fired a round of ball cartridge into
the promiscuous crowd, seriously wounding quite a large number
of citizens. Their captain, and the entire company of would-be
assassins, were arrested and brought to the corner of Madison and
Union streets, where the police were compelled to use their utmost
efforts to prevent the enraged and outraged citizens from lynching
the leaders of the gang of outlaws. The peace-loving and law-abiding
citizens were so exasperated at the audacity and cupidity of the
uncivilized horde that it was with difficulty the police induced them
to disperse without wreaking a summary vengeance upon these organized
<del>baddits</del><ins>bandits</ins>, who were beginning to operate
with impunity in the very midst of the highest order of civilization
and refinement.</p>

<p>The United States Supreme Court acknowledge and defend the right of
citizens to assemble, <em>without arms</em>, when the object is to make
known, in proper language, any grievance. But they must in all cases be
under the control, direction and protection

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">Pg&nbsp;15</a></span>

of the police force. But all meetings to organize, or any organized
gatherings for the purpose of subverting law and order, all
armed mobs making incendiary speeches or advocating violence
are subject to military law, and under the control of the police,
as the guardians of the public peace.</p>

<p>From the time of the arrest of <em>Herman Presser</em>, on the affirmation
of the militia law, by the Federal Court, in 1886, all armed
demonstrations of the socialistic element from this time ceased,
but in secret they matured their fiendish plottings against the
law-abiding citizens and safety of American institutions, becoming
skilled in the manufacture and use of dynamite bombs as a
weapon for the purpose of destroying life and property, and the
intimidation of the officers of law and justice.</p>

<p>The leaders of anarchy and socialism with whom we have
to do, more particularly in this volume, are viz.: August Spies,
Samuel Fielden and A. R. Parsons, Spies being the editor of
the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, and A. R. Parsons editor of the paper
known as the <cite>Alarm</cite>.</p>

<p>The <del>eight hour</del><ins>eight-hour</ins> system of labor had
been agitated for some time, and the first of May, 1886, was the time
set for it to go into effect by all the trade and labor unions. It was
suspected by many that the insubordinate element of socialists and
anarchists would take advantage of the already fermented state of the
working classes, to make a bold stand to revolutionize and demoralize,
by their treasonable and inflammatory speeches, the otherwise peaceful
and respectable citizens of Chicago. The McCormick reaper works, with
over one thousand employes, mostly foreigners, had been out on a strike
for several weeks, and being at fever heat the anarchists sought to
produce a riot among these turbulent men, who only needed a leader and
some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">Pg&nbsp;16</a></span>

encouragement, which they were soon to receive from Spies. On May 2d
a large force collected at or near the junction of Eighteenth street
and Centre avenue. Here they reversed the American flag, carrying it
top side down, symbolic of the revolution they intended to work in
American institutions. They marched down the Black Road to the prairie
in front of McCormick&rsquo;s works, where August Spies addressed them in
extravagant language, exciting the mob by a seditious and inflammatory
speech, at the close of which the effect was plainly visible, as the
mob at once attacked the works of McCormick, demolishing a portion of
it, and seriously injuring several non-union men who were employed
there. The six police there on duty bravely tried to hold the fort,
but were forced to give way before nearly three thousand infuriated
men, when they turned in a call for assistance, and were reinforced
by the arrival of thirty more officers, who bravely beat back their
<del>assaiiants</del><ins>assailants</ins>, killing one of the mob
by a shot from a revolver, and wounding several others. The repulsed
mob then retreated, and their leaders repaired to office of the
<cite>Zeitung</cite> to prepare a circular, and printed it in German
and English, which was headed <cite>Revenge</cite>, and the English
copy read as follows, which they circulated throughout the city:</p>

<h3>REVENGE.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Revenge, working men! to arms! Your masters sent out
   their bloodhounds&mdash;the police. They killed six of your
   brothers at McCormick&rsquo;s this afternoon. They killed the poor
   wretches, because they, like you, had the courage to disobey
   the supreme will of your bosses. They killed them because
   they dared ask for the shortening of the hours of toil. They
   killed them to show you, &lsquo;free American citizens,&rsquo; that you
   <em>must</em> be satisfied and contented with whatever your bosses
   condescend to allow

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">Pg&nbsp;17</a></span>

   you, or you&rsquo;ll get killed. You have for years endured the most
   abject humiliation; you have for years suffered immeasurable
   iniquities; you have worked yourselves to death; you have
   endured the pangs of want and hunger; your children you
   have sacrificed to the factory lords&mdash;in short, you
   have been miserable, obedient slaves all these years. Why?
   To satisfy the insatiable greed to fill the coffers of your
   lazy, thieving master. When you ask them now to lessen your
   burden he sends his blood<del>-</del>hounds out to shoot you, kill you.
   If you are men, if you are the sons of your grandsires who
   have shed their blood to free you, then you will rise in your
   might, Hercules, and destroy the hideous monster that seeks to
   destroy you. To arms we call you! To arms!</p>

   <p class="right smcap">Your Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The German portion <del>difiered</del><ins>differed</ins> from the
above mainly in the following passage: &ldquo;<em>Why? Because</em> you dared
ask for the shortening of the hours of labor.&rdquo; In the German copy
it ran: &ldquo;Because you dared ask for all that you believed to be your
rights.&rdquo; Instead of being addressed, as in the English, to American
citizens, it was directed to the followers of anarchy and socialism.</p>

<p>Another circular was distributed calling a meeting at the Haymarket
for the night of May 4, and urging <del>working-men</del><ins>working
men</ins> to arm and go in full force. In the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite> appeared the letter &ldquo;Y,&rdquo; meaning Ypsilon,
which was the signal for the armed anarchists to turn out, and in the
department of the paper known as the &ldquo;Letter-Box&rdquo; the word
&ldquo;Ruhe,&rdquo; signifying that the time for revolution was at
hand.</p>

<p>There were about three hundred and fifty anarchists carrying
concealed weapons at the <del>Haymarkst</del><ins>Haymarket</ins>
massacre on the 4th of May, 1886, and probably about fifteen hundred
present in all at the time of the explosion. A. R. Parsons had
delivered his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">Pg&nbsp;18</a></span>

speech and Samuel Fielden was portraying to the sympathizing crowd,
with all the eloquence he could command, the wide and yawning
unbridged gulf between capital and labor, when seven companies of
police, numbering nearly two hundred men, under command of their
superior officers, swooped down upon the lawless mob. Captain Ward,
in clear and ringing tones, commanded these land pirates to quietly
disperse, when from an alley contiguous was seen in the darkness
a little line of fire passing directly over the heads of the
<del>motly</del><ins>motley</ins> crowd. The hissing fiend, hurled
by some practiced hand to perform its hellish mission, fell directly
between two of the ranks of our brave and noble officers, and exploded
with a detonation which seemed to shake the city from center to
circumference, dealing death to several brave and noble officers, while
the wounded and dying numbered over sixty, who a moment before were in
the best of spirits and in the discharge of their duty as protectors of
public peace, were stricken down without a moment&rsquo;s warning. But was
there a man dismayed, although the groans of the wounded and mangled
victims could be heard in every direction, not knowing but the next
instant another explosion would strew the ground with fresh victims
from their ranks? Scarcely had the sound of the explosion died away in
the echoing distance, or the smoke from the fatal bomb rose up to be
lost in the dark and murky clouds, ere the spirit of patriotism rose
up in their hearts, inspiring them to deeds of noble daring, when they
boldly charged in a solid column this band of treacherous outlaws.
<em>Captain Bonfield</em> seized a revolver from the hand of a fallen
officer, at the same time drawing his own revolver, and from both hands
he rained a shower of lead into the ranks of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">Pg&nbsp;19</a></span>

enemy. Under this aggressive movement the anarchists began
beating a hasty retreat.</p>

<p>The wounded officers were removed to the <em>County Hospital</em>,
while a large detachment were kept busy during the night caring
for the dead and dying. The exact number of killed and
wounded among the anarchists could not be ascertained, as
they were removed from the ensanguined field immediately by
their friends to places of safety, and medical assistance secured
for them from among the socialistic fraternity.</p>

<p>On the 5th of May, Rudolph Schnaubelt was arrested on
suspicion that he was an important factor in the conspiracy. On
an investigation which followed, he very adroitly managed to
impress the authorities of his innocence, when he was discharged,
and he at once disappeared from the city; but during
the progress of the trial, evidence was obtained which proves
almost conclusively that Rudolph Schnaubelt was the arch fiend
who hurled the deadly bomb causing so many brave officers to
bite the dust without a moment&rsquo;s warning.</p>

<p>This great and unprecedented anarchistic conspiracy of May
4th will doubtless result in a blessing to America. First, it
will teach the administrators of law and justice the necessity of
being watchful of this treacherous element in society which
would thus ruthlessly violate every sacred principle of right and
honor.</p>

<p>The bravery of the police on that eventful night of May
4th is worthy of note in the history of Chicago, and those who
fell in the defence of our birthrights as American citizens have
builded a monument in the hearts of a grateful people that shall
endure while the star-spangled banner shall continue to wave
&ldquo;O&rsquo;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.&rdquo; Were
we to disturb, disquiet, and bring up from their tombs the most
hideous monsters from the dead of the dark and superstitious
ages of the gloomy past, their hands deep purple with the blood
of their murdered fellow men, we should fail to find a parallel
that would compare with this unscrupulous cold-blooded massacre,
along with the bold attempt at the subversion of law.</p>

<p>On the fifth of the month eight of the leaders of anarchy
were arrested and indicted for murder and conspiracy. The
police raided the office of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>,
the organ of the socialistic and anarchistic labor agitators,
obtaining quantities of dynamite bombs, flags, and
<del>inflamatory</del><ins>inflammatory</ins> literature which
was offered in the trial as corroborative evidence. <span
class="smcap">August Spies</span>, a German, was the editor of the
<cite>Zeitung</cite> and a ringleader of the anarchists. <span
class="smcap">A. R. Parsons</span>, an American, was editor of the
<cite>Alarm</cite>. <span class="smcap">Samuel Fielden</span>, of
English nationality, laborer. <span class="smcap">Oscar Neebe</span>,
German. <span class="smcap">Adolph Fischer</span>, a German. </p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">Pg&nbsp;21</a></span></p>

<p class="continued"><span class="smcap">Louis
<del>Ling</del><ins>Lingg</ins></span>, a German, carpenter. <span
class="smcap">George <del>Engle</del><ins>Engel</ins></span>, German,
and <span class="smcap">Michal Schwab</span>. These are the ones who
were indicted for murder and anarchy. A. R. Parsons fled the night
of the riot and consequently was not arrested, but he subsequently
came in and gave himself up to the officials in the criminal court,
doubtless thinking by this semblance of honor to impress the court of
his innocence and thereby secure acquittal.</p>

<p>The attorneys for the State in the prosecution were as follows:
Julius S. Grinnell; and assistants State, George Ingham
and Frank Walker.</p>

<p>Col. W. P. Black, Solomon Zeisler, and Mr. Foster, of Iowa,
were for the defence, who availed themselves of every technicality
in the interests of their clients. Four long and tedious
weeks were consumed in obtaining a jury, exhausting fourteen
panels of jurors in securing twelve competent men to try this
case. His Honor, Judge J. E. Gary, presiding.</p>

<p>The names of the jury accepted by the State and the defence
were Major J. H. Cole, F. E. Osborne, S. G. Randall, A. H.
Reed, J. H. Bruyton, A. Hamilton, G. W. Adams, J. B. Greiner,
C. B. Todd, C. A. Ludwig, T. E. Denker, and H. T. Sanford.</p>

<p>An application was filed with State&rsquo;s Attorney Grinnell for
a separate trial in the case of Neebe, Spies, Schwab, and Fielden,
but was overruled by his Honor, Judge Gary, as they had been
jointly indicted for conspiracy and murder.</p>

<p>On Friday, July 10th, 1886, the case of the anarchists was
opened by the prosecution in the taking of evidence.</p>

<p>Officers Steel, Barber, Reed and McMahon, who were
wounded in the riot of May the 4th, were so far recovered as to
be able to be present.</p>

<p>Felix Puschek was sworn and submitted plans of the Haymarket

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">Pg&nbsp;22</a></span>

and several halls in the city known to be headquarters
for the meetings of the anarchists.</p>

<p>Police Inspector Bonfield next took the stand and related
how the police attempted to disperse the unlawful assemblage
of armed Anarchists, and detailed the circumstance of the
bomb-throwing, already related. He also identified the following
circular, by which the meeting was called:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Attention, working men! Great mass-meeting to-night, at
   7 o&rsquo;clock, Haymarket square, between Desplaines and Halsted.
   Good speakers will be present to denounce the late atrocious
   act of the police, the shooting of our fellow working men yesterday
   afternoon. Working men, arm and appear in full force.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="right smcap">&ldquo;The Committee.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the <del>anarchist&rsquo;s</del><ins>anarchists</ins> indicted
for conspiracy turned State&rsquo;s evidence. Gottfried Waller, a Swiss
by nationality, a cabinet-maker by trade, formerly a socialist, and
a member of the Lehr and Wehr Verein, testified that the latter
organization comprised various armed groups of anarchists; that the
letter &ldquo;Y&rdquo; in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> meant for the armed
section to meet at <del>Grief&rsquo;s</del><ins>Greif&rsquo;s</ins> hall; that he
acted as chairman of the meeting of seventy or eighty persons, Engel,
Fischer and Breitenfeld, the commander of the Lehr and Wehr, being
present. The witness testified that Engel unfolded a plan whereby if a
collision between the strikers and the police should occur, the word
&ldquo;Ruhe&rdquo; would appear in the <cite>Arbeiter</cite> as a signal for the
Lehr and Wehr and the Northwest group of anarchists to assemble in
Wicker Park with arms. They should then storm the North avenue police
station, and proceed thence to other stations, using dynamite and
shooting down all who opposed them, and should cut the telegraph wires
to prevent communication with the outside

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">Pg&nbsp;23</a></span>

world. Engel said the best way to begin would be to throw a
dynamite bomb into the police station, and that when the populace
saw that the police were overpowered, tumult would
spread through the city, and the anarchists would be joined by
the working men. This plan, Engel said, had been adopted by
the Northwest group. It was decided to appoint a committee
to keep watch of affairs in the city and to call a meeting for the
next night in the Haymarket. Fischer was directed to get the
handbills calling the meeting printed. Those present at the preliminary
meeting represented various groups throughout the
city. Fischer announced that the word &ldquo;Ruhe&rdquo; would mean
that a revolution had been started. Engel put the motion, and
the plan was adopted. The committee on action was composed
of members from each group; the witness knew only one&mdash;Kraemer.
The members of the armed groups were known by
numbers, and witness number was 19.</p>

<p>Spies was questioned in January, 1885, at Grand Rapids,
Mich., relative to these secret organizations, when he said that
force must bring about the necessary reform which the ballot-box
had failed to inaugurate and was incompetent to perform.
Shook, of Grand Rapids, also testified that Spies had said that
the secret drilled organizations of Chicago for the revolution of
society numbered over 3,000, and that none except members of
those organizations knew of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus operandi</span>
by which they intended to wage their warfare.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Bowler testified to seeing men in the crowd fire
upon the police with revolvers; officers S. C. Bohner and E. J.
Hawley saw Fielden fire. In the line of proving up the conspiracy
to incite the working men to violence, it was shown by the
evidence of James L. Frazer, E. T. Baker, A. S. Leckie, Frank

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">Pg&nbsp;24</a></span>

Haraster, Sergeant John Enright and officer L. H. McShane,
that Spies and Fielden incited the mob to attack McCormick&rsquo;s
Reaper Works and the non-union employes on May 3. Detective
Reuben Slayton testified to having arrested Fischer at the
<cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office. He had a loaded revolver hid under his
coat; a file-grooved dagger and a fulminating cap, used to
explode dynamite bombs. Theodore Fricke, former business
manager of the <cite>Arbeiter</cite>, identified the copy of the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo;
circular as being in Spies&rsquo; handwriting. Lieutenant William
Ward testified to having commanded the Haymarket meeting to
disperse in the name of the people of Illinois, and that Fielden
cried, &ldquo;We are peaceable,&rdquo; laying a slight emphasis on the last
word.</p>

<p>William Seliger, of 442 Sedgwick street, testified that Louis
Lingg boarded with him, and that himself, Lingg, Huebner, Manzenberg
and Hewmann worked at making dynamite bombs of a spherical shape.
He attended the various meetings. He identified the calls for
the armed sections to meet in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>.
<del>Balthasar</del><ins>Balthazar</ins> Rau brought the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo;
circular to Zephf&rsquo;s hall. Lingg worked at first on &ldquo;gas-pipe&rdquo; bombs;
they made forty or fifty bombs the Tuesday before the riot. Lingg said
they were to be used that evening; he and Lingg carried a small trunk
full of the bombs to Neff&rsquo;s hall, 58 Clybourne avenue, that evening,
where they were divided up among the anarchists; besides the Northwest
group the Sachsen Bund met at Neff&rsquo;s hall; witness, Lingg, Thieben
and Gustave Lehmen and two others from the Lehr and Wehr Verein, left
Neff&rsquo;s hall for the Larrabee street police station; Lingg said a
disturbance must be made on the North side to prevent the police from
going to the West side; Lingg wanted to throw a bomb into the station;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">Pg&nbsp;25</a></span>

the police were outside, and they could not get near; the patrol-wagon
came along completely manned, and Lingg wanted to throw a bomb under
the wagon; he asked witness for fire from his cigar; witness went into
a hallway and lit a match, and before he returned the wagon had passed:
they returned to Neff&rsquo;s hall where he heard a bomb had fallen on
the West side, and killed a great many; Hewmann blamed Lingg and said
in an angry voice, &ldquo;You are the cause of it all;&rdquo; they
then went and hid their bombs under sidewalks and in various places,
and went home; Lingg first brought dynamite to the house about six
weeks before May 1, in a long wooden box; he made a wooden spoon to
handle it with in filling the bombs; witness belonged to the Northwest
group, and his number was 72, Engel was also a member. [The bombs were
here produced and Judge Gary ordered them removed immediately from
the <del>court room</del><ins>courtroom</ins> and from the building.]
Seliger&rsquo;s testimony was unshaken on cross-examination. Mrs.
Bertha Seliger corroborated her husband&rsquo;s testimony, testifying
that at one time six or seven men were at work making bombs, and that
after the Haymarket Lingg tore up the floor of a closet to secrete
those he had on hand.</p>

<p>Lieutenant John D. Shea, Chief of the Detective force, testified
to having assisted in the raid on the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>
office, May 5. The galley of type from which the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; circular was
printed, copies of Herr Most&rsquo;s book, and other anarchistic literature,
red flags and banners with treasonable devices, and a quantity of
dynamite were found. The witness asked Spies if he wrote the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo;
circular, and he refused to answer. When he arrested Fischer he asked
him where he was on the night of the Haymarket meeting. Fisher said in
the <cite>Arbeiter <del>Zietung</del><ins>Zeitung</ins></cite> office
with Schwab, and that Rau brought word that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">Pg&nbsp;26</a></span>

Spies was at the Haymarket, that a big crowd was there, and
they all went over. He had a belt, a dagger, and a fulminating
cap on him when arrested, but he said he carried them for protection.
I said: &lsquo;You didn&rsquo;t need them in the office.&rsquo; He said:
&lsquo;I intended to go away, but was arrested.&rsquo; I also said: &lsquo;There
has been found other weapons like this sharpened dagger; how
is it you come to carry this?&rsquo; He said he put it in his pocket
for his own protection.</p>

<p>Detective William Jones testified that he had a locksmith
open a closet in Spies office, and in a desk were found two bars
of dynamite, a long fuse, a box of fulminating caps, some letters,
and copies of both the celebrated circulars. At Fischer&rsquo;s home
he found a lot of cartridges and a blouse of the Lehr und Wehr
Verein. Officer Duffy found two thousand copies of the circular
calling upon the working men to arm, and the manuscript of
the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; circular in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office. Herr
Most&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;The Science of Revolutionary Warfare,&rdquo; found in
the <cite>Arbeiter</cite> office, was offered in evidence; also the manual for
the manufacture of explosives and poisons.</p>

<p>Bernhard Schrader, a native of Prussia, five years in this
country, a carpenter by trade, testified that he was a member of
the Lehr und Wehr Verein; was at the meeting at Greif&rsquo;s hall
the night of May 3, and he corroborated Waller&rsquo;s testimony
throughout. Besides those mentioned by Waller, Schrader named
Hadermann, Thiel and Danafeldt, as attendants at the meeting. He
saw <del>Balthausar</del><ins>Balthazar</ins> Rau distributing the
&ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; circulars at a meeting of the Carpenter&rsquo;s
Union on Desplaines street. Witness was present also at the Sunday
meeting on Emma street. It was here agreed to cripple the fire
department, in case they were called out, by cutting their hose. Witness

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">Pg&nbsp;27</a></span>

went to the meeting at 54 West Lake street in response to the signal
&ldquo;Y&rdquo; in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>. He was at the
Haymarket, but did not know who threw the bomb. The Northwest group of
the Lehr und Wehr were armed with Springfield rifles. Witness&rsquo;
number in the organization was 3,312.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Edward Steele testified that when the police
entered the Haymarket somebody cried out: &ldquo;Here come the
blood<del>-</del>hounds. You do your duty, and we&rsquo;ll do ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Michael Quinn testified that he heard this exclamation
and that the man who made it was Fielden, just as he
ceased speaking on the wagon. About the instant the bomb
exploded, Fielden exclaimed: &ldquo;We are peaceable!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Stanton testified that the bomb exploded four
seconds after his company of eighteen men entered the Haymarket.
Every member of his company except two were
wounded, and two&mdash;Degan and Redden&mdash;killed. The witness
was wounded in eleven places. Officers Krueger and Wessler
testified to having seen Fielden shoot at the police with a revolver.</p>

<p>Gustave Lehman, one of the conspirators, gave a detailed
account of various meetings; the afternoon of May 4 he was at
Lingg&rsquo;s house where men with cloths over their faces were
making dynamite bombs; Huebner was cutting fuse; Lingg
gave witness a small hand-satchel with two bombs, fuse, caps,
and a can of dynamite; at 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning, after the
Haymarket explosion, he got out of bed and carried this material
back to Ogden&rsquo;s grove and hid it, where it was found by Officer
Hoffman; money to buy dynamite was raised at a dance of the
Carpenters&rsquo; Union, at Florus&rsquo; Hall, 71 West Lake street. Lingg
took this money and bought dynamite; Lingg taught them how

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">Pg&nbsp;28</a></span>

to make bombs. M. H. Williamson and Clarence P. Dresser,
reporters, had heard Fielden, Parsons and Spies counsel violence;
the latter at the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office had advised that the
new Board of Trade be blown up on the night of its opening.
George Munn and Herman Pudewa, printers, worked on the
&ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; circular in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office; Richard
Reichel, office-boy, got the &ldquo;copy&rdquo; for it from Spies.</p>

<p>The most sensational evidence of the trial, as showing the
inside workings of the armed sections of the socialists, and at
the same time the most damaging as indicative of their motives
and designs, was that of Detective Andrew C. Johnson, of the
Pinkerton agency, an entirely disinterested person who was
detailed in December, 1884, by his agency, which had been
employed by the First National Bank to furnish details of the
secret meetings which it was known were being held by revolutionary
plotters at various places throughout the city. Johnson
is a Scandinavian, thin-faced and sandy-haired, born in Copenhagen,
and thirty-five years of age. He told his story in a calm,
collected, business-like manner. Mr. Grinnell asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know any of the defendants?&rdquo; Witness&mdash;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name them.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons, Fielden, Spies, Schwab and
Lingg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you at any time connected with any group of the
International Workingmen&rsquo;s Association?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What group?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The American group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you a member of any armed section of the socialists
of this city?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you begin attendance at their meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
first meeting I attended was the 22d of February 1885, at

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">Pg&nbsp;29</a></span>

Baum&rsquo;s pavilion. The last meeting I attended was the 24th of
January of this year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At whose instance did you go to their meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At the
instance of my agency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you from time to time make reports of what you heard
and saw at their meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell passed over to witness a bundle of papers and
asked: &ldquo;Have you in your hand a report of the meeting of the
22d of February, 1885?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were any of the defendants present at that meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir; Parsons was present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Refer to your memoranda and tell me what was said by
Parsons at that meeting.&rdquo;&mdash;Objected to; overruled.&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons
stated that the reason the meeting had been called in that locality
was so as to give the many merchant princes who resided there
an opportunity to attend and see what the Communists had to
say about the distribution of wealth. He said: &lsquo;I want you all
to unite together and throw off the yoke. We need no president,
no congressmen, no police, no militia, and no judges.
They are all leeches, sucking the blood of the poor, who have
to support them all by their labor. I say to you, rise one and
all, and let us exterminate them all. Woe to the police or to
the military whom they send against us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was where?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At Baum&rsquo;s pavilion, corner of Cottage
Grove avenue and Twenty-second street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you a report of any other of the defendants speaking
at that meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the next memorandum that you have?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
next meeting was March 1. That night I became a member. I
went to Thielen, who was at the time acting as treasurer and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">Pg&nbsp;30</a></span>

secretary for the association, and gave him my name and signified
my willingness to join the association. He entered my name
in a book and handed me a red card with my name on and a
number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When and where was that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That was March 1, 1885, at
<del>Griefs</del><ins>Greif&rsquo;s</ins> hall, No. 54 West Lake street, in
this city.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you what was said and done at that meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
have a report of it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who spoke?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons, Fielden, Spies, and others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any other of the defendants?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;State what Fielden said, and then what Parsons said.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A
lecture was given by a man named Bailey on the subject of
socialism and christianity, and the question arose as to whether
christianity ought to be introduced in their meetings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Fielden, Spies and Parsons say there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden
said that he thought this matter ought not to be introduced
into their meetings. Parsons said, &lsquo;I am of the same opinion,&rsquo;
and Spies also said that it ought not to be introduced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now state the next meeting.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next meeting was
March 4, at the same place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were present?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons, Fielden and Spies were present,
and spoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the memorandum made that you have of that
meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The same day, immediately after the termination
of the meeting. Parsons said: &lsquo;We are sorely in need of funds
to publish the <cite>Alarm</cite>. As many of you as are able ought to
give as much as you can, because our paper is our most powerful
weapon, and it is only through the paper that we can hope
to reach the masses.&rsquo; During his lecture he introduced christianity.
Spies stood up and said: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want any christianity

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">Pg&nbsp;31</a></span>

here in our meetings at all. We have told you so before.&rsquo;
Fielden made no speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;March 22.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were any speeches made by any of the defendants
there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir, Spies spoke. Previously a man
named Bishop introduced a resolution of sympathy for a girl named
Sorell. Bishop stated that the girl had been assaulted by her master.
She had applied for a warrant, which had been refused her on account
of the high social standing of her master. Spies said: &lsquo;What is
the use of passing resolutions? We must act, and revenge the girl.
Here is a fine opportunity for some of our young men to go and shoot
Wight.&rsquo; That was the man who had assaulted the girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do your reports contain references to speeches made by
others?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are only picking out speeches made by the
defendants?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;March 29, 1885, at
<del>Grief&rsquo;s</del><ins>Greif&rsquo;s</ins> hall. The defendant, Fielden,
spoke at that meeting. He said: &lsquo;A few explosions in the city of
Chicago would help the cause considerably. There is the new Board of
Trade, a roost of thieves and robbers. We ought to commence by blowing
that up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were other speeches made at that meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There
were, but no others made by the defendants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;April 1, at Greif&rsquo;s hall.
Spies, Fielden and Parsons were present at the meeting. Spies
made a lengthy speech on this occasion. His speech was in regard
to acts of cruelty committed by the police in Chicago; he
spoke of the number of arrests made, and the number of convictions

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">Pg&nbsp;32</a></span>

in proportion. He also referred to the case of the girl who
preferred a charge of assault against police-sergeant Patton, of
the West Chicago avenue station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else spoke there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden. Spies had said before
that he had advised the girl to get a pistol and go and shoot
the policeman. Fielden stood up and said; &lsquo;That is what she
ought to do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;April 8, 1885,
at Greif&rsquo;s hall. Parsons made a lengthy speech. He referred
frequently in his address to the strike at the McCormick harvester
works. He said: &lsquo;There is but one of two things for the men to
do. They must either go to work for the wages offered them or else
starve.&rsquo; In concluding his remarks he referred to the strike
at La Salle, Illinois. He said: &lsquo;To-morrow morning or the next
day the authorities here in the city will probably send a trainload
of policemen or militia to La Salle to shoot down the working people
there. Now, there is a way to prevent this. All you have to do is to
get some soap and place it on the rails and the train will be unable to
move.&rsquo; Parsons spoke at great length of the crimes, as he termed
them, of the capitalists, and he said to those present that it was an
absolute necessity for them to unite against them, as that was the only
way they could fight the capitalists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else spoke there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden. He said it was a
blessing something had been discovered wherewith the working
men could fight the police and militia with their Gatling guns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the next meeting you had?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;April 19. That
meeting was held at No. 106 Randolph street, because the hall
at No. 54 Lake street was engaged. At this meeting Parsons
offered a resolution of sympathy for Louis Riel and the half-breeds

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">Pg&nbsp;33</a></span>

in the Northwest who were in rebellion against the Canadian
government. Neither Parsons nor Fielden spoke at the
meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;April 22, at
Greif&rsquo;s hall. Referring to the opening of the new Board of Trade
building, Parsons said: &lsquo;What a splendid opportunity there will
be next Tuesday night for some bold fellow to make the capitalists
tremble by blowing up the building and all the thieves and robbers
that are there.&rsquo; At the conclusion of his speech he said that
the working men of Chicago should form in processions on Market square
Tuesday evening next, and he invited all those present to get as many
of their friends as they could to join in the procession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any other of the defendants speak
there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden said: &lsquo;I also wish to invite
as many of you as can come and as many as you can get. Go around to the
lodging-houses and get all you can to join in the procession&mdash;the
more the merrier.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;April 26, at
Greif&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any of the defendants speak
there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There were present Parsons, Fielden, Spies.
Parsons said: &lsquo;I wish you all to consider the misery of the
working classes, and the cause of all the misery is these institutions
termed government. I lived on snow<del>-</del>balls all last winter, but, by
G&mdash;d! I won&rsquo;t do it this winter.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the next meeting at which any of the defendants
attended?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;April 30, at Market square; Parsons and Fielden.
Parsons said: &lsquo;We have assembled here to determine in
which way best to celebrate the dedication of the new Board of
Trade building, and to give the working men of Chicago a
chance to state their views in the matter&rsquo;. Fielden then said:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">Pg&nbsp;34</a></span>

&lsquo;I want all the working men of Chicago, the country, and the
world in general to arm themselves and sweep the capitalists off
the face of the earth.&rsquo; Parsons then said: &lsquo;Every working
man in Chicago must save a little of his wages every week until
he has enough to buy a Colt&rsquo;s revolver and a Winchester rifle,
for the only way that the working people will get their rights
is by the point of the bayonet. We want you to form in procession
now, and we will march to the Board of Trade. We
will halt there, and while the band is playing we will sing the
Marseillaise.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you march in the procession, too?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you in that line of march?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was in the
center of the procession.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did any of the defendants march with you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not with
me, but in the procession Fielden, Spies, Parsons and Neebe
marched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There was something
<del>occured</del><ins>occurred</ins> the night of May 30. I was
standing at the corner of Washington street and Fifth avenue close
behind Spies. That was Decoration day, and as the procession passed
by, Spies said: &lsquo;A half-dozen dynamite bombs would scatter them
all.&rsquo; A little later a gentleman who was standing near remarked
upon the fine appearance of the Illinois National Guard, who were then
passing. Spies said: &lsquo;They are only boys, and would be no use in
case of a riot. Fifty determined men would soon disarm them
all.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next meeting was
on the Lake front, May 31, and Fielden and Parsons was there.
Fielden said: &lsquo;It is only by strength and force that you can

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">Pg&nbsp;35</a></span>

overthrow the government.&rsquo; Parsons also spoke, but I don&rsquo;t recollect
what he said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on to the next meeting.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next meeting was June
7, at Ogden&rsquo;s grove. There were present Fielden, Parsons and
Spies. Fielden said: &lsquo;Every working man in Chicago ought
to belong to organizations. It is of no use to go to our masters
to give us more wages or better times. I mean for you to use
force. It is of no use for the working people to hope to gain
anything by means of an ordinary weapon. Every one of you
must learn the use of dynamite, for that is the power with which
we hope to gain our rights.&rsquo; Schwab also spoke at that meeting
in German, which I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next meeting was
August 19, at Greif&rsquo;s hall. Parsons and Fielden spoke. Parsons
referred to the late strike of the street car employes, and
said that if but one shot had been fired, and Bonfield had happened
to be shot, the whole city would have been deluged in
blood, and social revolution would have been inaugurated. The
next meeting was August 24, at Greif&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of a fellow named Bodendecke speaking at
those meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Occasionally, but not frequently; I don&rsquo;t
know where he is now. There were some twenty or twenty-three
men present at that meeting, and twenty women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Name who were present.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Besides the two defendants,
Parsons, and Fielden, there was Baltus, Bodendecke, Boyd,
Lawson, Parker, Franklin and Schneider.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;State what <del>occured</del><ins>occurred</ins>
there.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;After being there a short time a man armed
with a long cavalry sword and dressed in a blue blouse and wearing a
slouch hat came into the room. He ordered all those present to fall in.
He then called off certain

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">Pg&nbsp;36</a></span>

names, and all those present answered to their names. He inquired
whether there were any new members who wished to join
the military company, and some one replied that there was. He
then said: &lsquo;Whoever wants to join step to the front.&rsquo; Myself
and two others stepped to the front. We were asked separately
to give our names. I gave my name, which was put down in a
book, and I was then told that my number was 16. Previous
to my name being put down in the book, a man to whom I was
speaking asked whether there was any one present who knew
me, or whether any one could vouch for my being a true man.
The defendant, Parsons and Bodendecke spoke up and said they
would vouch for me. The other two were asked their names in
turn, and as they were properly vouched for, their names were
entered in a similar manner in a book, and they were given
numbers. The man who came into the room armed then inquired
of two other men in the room whether they were members
of the American group. Both said they were and he asked
to see their cards. As they were unable to show cards they
were expelled, as were two others. The doors were closed and
the remainder were asked to fall in line, and we were drilled
about three-quarters of an hour&mdash;put through a regular manual
of drill, marching, countermarching, wheeling, forming fours,
etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who drilled you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The man that came in with the
sword; I didn&rsquo;t ascertain his name. At the expiration of that
time the drill-instructor stated that he would now introduce
some of the members of the first company of the German organization.
He went outside and in a few minutes returned accompanied
by ten other men, dressed as he himself was, each one
armed with a Springfield rifle. When they all got into the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">Pg&nbsp;37</a></span>

room he placed them in line facing us and introduced them as
members of the first company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein.
He said that he was going to drill them a little while to let us
see how far they had got with their drill. He drilled them
about ten minutes in a regular musket drill. At the end of
that time a man in the employ of the proprietor of the saloon at
No. 54 West Lake street came into the room with two tin boxes,
which he placed on the table at the south end of the room. The
drill-instructor then asked all those present to step up and examine
the two tin boxes, as they were the latest improved dynamite
bomb. I stepped to the front with the others, and examined
the two tins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Describe them as near as you can.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They were about the
size and had the appearance of ordinary preserved fruit cans. The
top part unscrewed, and on the inside the cans were filled with a
light-brown mixture. There was also a small glass tube inserted in
the center of the can. The tube was in connection with a screw,
and it was explained that when the can was thrown against any hard
<del>sabstance</del><ins>substance</ins> it would explode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that mixture a liquid?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Inside of the glass tube
was a liquid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there anything around that glass tube?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir;
it was a brownish mixture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that a liquid?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir; it looked more like fine
sawdust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you feel of it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not. The drill-instructor told
us we should be very careful about selecting new members of
company, because if we were not, there was no telling whom we
might get into our midst. The next proceeding of the evening
was to select officers. A man named Walters was chosen Captain,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">Pg&nbsp;38</a></span>

and Parsons was chosen Lieutenant. Some discussion
arose as to what the company should be called. It was decided
eventually that we should be called the International Rifles.
The drill-instructor then suggested that we ought to choose some
other hall, as we were not quite safe there. He added: &lsquo;We
have a fine place at No. 636 Milwaukee avenue. We have a
shooting range in the basement, where we practice shooting regularly.&rsquo;
Parsons inquired whether it was not possible for us to
rent the same place. The drill-instructor informed him he did
not know. The question of renting another hall was postponed,
and our next meeting was fixed for the next Monday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Salomon&mdash;&ldquo;A meeting of what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Witness&mdash;&ldquo;A meeting of the armed section of the American
group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell&mdash;&ldquo;Who drilled that company that
night?&rdquo;&mdash;Witness&mdash;&ldquo;That German, and Parsons and Fielden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The following Monday,
the 31st of August, at the same place. Parsons and Fielden
were present, and others. That was a meeting of the armed section,
and it was held at Greif&rsquo;s hall. Capt. Walters drilled us
about an hour and a half. Afterward a consultation was held
by the members of the company as to the best way of procuring
arms. Some one suggested that each member should pay so
much a week until a sufficient amount had been raised wherewith
to purchase a rifle for each member of the company. Parsons
said: &lsquo;Look here, boys, why can&rsquo;t we make a raid some
night on the militia armory? There are only two or three men
on guard there, and it is easily done.&rsquo; This suggestion seemed
to be favored by the members, and it was finally decided to put
the matter off until the nights got a little longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">Pg&nbsp;39</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. Black&mdash;&ldquo;Which matter was put off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Witness&mdash;&ldquo;The raid on the armory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell&mdash;&ldquo;When was the next
meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;Witness&mdash;&ldquo;September 3, 1885, at No. 54 West Lake
street. Fielden made a speech there and said: &lsquo;It is useless for you
to suppose that you can ever obtain anything in any other way than by
force. You must arm yourselves and prepare for the coming revolution.&rsquo;
That was one of the ordinary meetings of the association. The next
meeting was October 11, at Twelfth street Turner hall. Spies and
Fielden were present. Fielden said: &lsquo;The Eight-Hour law will be of no
benefit to the working men. You must organize and use force. You must
crush out the present Government by force. It is the only way in which
you can better your present condition.&rsquo; I left with Fielden before the
meeting terminated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When was the next meeting you attended?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next
meeting was December 20, at Twelfth street Turner hall. Fielden
was present. He said: &lsquo;All the crowned heads of Europe
are trembling at the very name of Socialism, and I hope soon to
see a few Liskes in the United States to put away a few of the
tools of the capitalists. The execution of Riel in the Northwest
was downright murder.&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Was that an open meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
was as far as I know. I saw no one refused admission.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about those other meetings you have mentioned, aside
from the armed sections?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Aside from the meetings of the
armed section I should say that they were public. I never saw
any one refused admission.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Was there any precaution
taken?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A precaution was taken in this way: A member
of the group was generally stationed at the door, and as each

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">Pg&nbsp;40</a></span>

member entered the hall he was closely scrutinized. The next
meeting was December 30.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What place?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At No. 106 Randolph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who spoke there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden. At this meeting a stranger
asked a question, and Fielden replied to the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the question was?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The question
was: &lsquo;Would the destruction of private property assist universal
co-operation?&rsquo; Fielden replied: &lsquo;Neither I or any body
else can tell what is going to be in a hundred years from now,
but this everybody knows: If private property is done away
with, it would insure a better state of things generally. And
we are trying all we can to teach the people the best way in
which to bring about this change.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was present at that meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden, only.
The next meeting was January of this year, at Twelfth street
Turner hall. Fielden and Schwab were present. Fielden, referring
to the troubles in Ireland, said: &lsquo;If every Irishman
would become a Socialist, he would have a better opportunity
to secure home-rule for Ireland. I want all Irishmen to destroy
all the private property they can lay their hands on.&rsquo; He also
referred to other matters. What he said had reference to Pinkerton&rsquo;s
detective agency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it he said?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He said Pinkerton&rsquo;s detectives
were a lot of cold-blooded murderers, and the worst enemies the
working men had, and they were all in the pay of the capitalists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all that was said there? Was that one of these ordinary
opening meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else happened?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Schwab also addressed this meeting
in German. During his speech he was frequently applauded.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">Pg&nbsp;41</a></span>

The next meeting I attended was January 14, at No. 106
Randolph Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;January of this year?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was said at this meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Before the meeting
commenced the defendants, Fielden and Spies, had a conversation
which I overheard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That was held in the hall near the
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;State what you heard.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Spies said to Fielden: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
say very much about that article on Anarchists in an afternoon
paper. You simply need to state that a reporter of the paper
had an interview with me a few days ago, but that most of the
statements of the paper are lies.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How was that conversation carried on?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was carried
on quietly and was not meant for anybody else to hear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Capt. Black objected to the last part of the answer, and
succeeded in having it stricken out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the tone of voice?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In whispers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did they leave?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Spies further said: &lsquo;You must
be careful in your remarks. You don&rsquo;t know who might be
amongst us to-night.&rsquo; Spies then went away and the meeting
was called to order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Fielden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He made a long talk, commenting
on the articles that appeared. He said almost all of the statements
were lies. He said in regard to dynamite bombs: &lsquo;It is
quite true we have lots of explosives and dynamite in our possession,
and we will not hesitate to use them when the proper
time comes. We care nothing at all either for the military or
the police. All of these are in the pay of the capitalists.&rsquo; He

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">Pg&nbsp;42</a></span>

further said that &lsquo;even in the regular army most of the soldiers
are in sympathy with us, and most of them have been driven to
enlist. I have had a letter from a friend out West. He told
me that he had seen a soldier on the frontier reading a copy of
the <cite>Alarm</cite>.&rsquo; Others then made speeches. Afterward Fielden
again spoke at the same meeting in regard to the question asked
him, what was the Socialist idea of the eight-hour movement.
Fielden said: &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t object to but we don&rsquo;t believe in it.
Whether a man works eight hours a day or ten hours a day he
is still a slave. We propose to abolish slavery altogether.&rsquo; That
is all of that meeting. Fielden said, the 24th of January, at a
meeting held at No. 106 Randolph street&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the name of that, Jung&rsquo;s hall?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I believe
it is Jung&rsquo;s hall. Fielden said good results were sure to follow
the abolishment of private property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you quit this branch of your business?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
latter part of January last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you know then of Pinkerton&rsquo;s agency having any other
men employed in the same line that you were employed in?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
knew there had been another man, but whether he was employed
then I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you lately, within the last few days, ascertained, and
do you know the fact, that you have seen any Pinkerton men in
these meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That is so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you did not know it at that time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not know
it at that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often did you drill with the armed section?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Only
twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often did they drill?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Once a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">Pg&nbsp;43</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got any information from any other members of
the organization? If they drilled after that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Objected to and withdrawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ascertain from any of the defendants if they drilled
after that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had any other talk with Parsons outside of these
utterances?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you had any talk with Spies, Fielden, Parsons, and
other defendants as to the purposes of their organization?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
have talked frequently with Parsons and Fielden at various
times and at various places. I cannot recollect as to what was
said at each place and when it was said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you give me the substance or purport of what was
said at any time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Black objected, unless time and place were given.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the object of the armed section as was expressed
by the members?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At the first meeting of the armed section
the discussion arose as to what the company should be called.
Some one suggested that the company should be amalgamated
with the German organization, and the company was to be called
the Fourth Company of the Lehr und Wehr Verein. This idea
was opposed, and finally it was decided that it should be called
the International Rifles. It was further said and understood by
all the members that in case of a conflict with the authorities the
International Rifles were to act in concert with the Lehr und
Wehr Verein, and obey the orders of the officers of that organization.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was said at any time as to when this revolution was
to take place&mdash;when was to be the culmination of the conflict?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
1st of May was frequently mentioned as a good opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">Pg&nbsp;44</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What 1st of May?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This present. As far as I remember
it was at a meeting at Twelfth street Turner hall on one
occasion in December, and it was the defendant Fielden that
said the 1st of May would be the time to strike the blow. There
would be so many strikes and there would be 50,000 men out of
work&mdash;that is to say if the eight-hour movement was a failure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever met any of them at the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>
office?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What conversation did you have?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I had a conversation
with Parsons some time in March. The conversation took place in
the <cite>Alarm</cite> office in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>
building. This office is situated in the back of the building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, state what you remember of the conversation.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
asked Parsons if he did not think it advisable to get some papers
printed in the Scandinavian language, as I thought I could make
use of them. I intended to distribute them among the Scandinavian
people along Milwaukee avenue and that neighborhood.
Parsons replied: &lsquo;Yes, it is a good idea, and the best thing you
can do is to bring the matter up in our next meeting. Bring it
up before the meeting, and I will see that it is attended to. It
is no use, we must have the Scandinavians with us.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have any talk with any of these defendants about
the purposes and objects of the social revolution, so-called?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
have had numerous conversations with Fielden and Parsons
but I cannot remember distinctly what was said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Parsons&rsquo; relation to the <cite>Alarm</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He was
the editor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a book by Most called &lsquo;The Modern
Science of Revolutionary Warfare?&rsquo; Look at that book and
state whether you have seen it before.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">Pg&nbsp;45</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have seen it at meetings at Twelfth street
Turner hall; at No. 54 West Lake street, and also at No. 106
Randolph.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who had charge of the distribution of it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Chairman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of the respective meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were they sold or given away?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They were sold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether or not any steps were taken to distribute
the <cite>Alarm</cite>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were a number of those present at that particular
meeting who bought a number of copies of the <cite>Alarm</cite>, and said
that they would try their best to sell them and obtain new subscribers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know a man named Schneider and one Thomas
Brown?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they belong to the American group?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Both of
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they belong to the armed section?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Both of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where usually did the American group meet before the
time you ceased your connection with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During the last few meetings it met at No. 106 Randolph
street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prior to that where did it meet?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It had met at No. 54
West Lake street, also at No. 45 North Clark street, and on the
Lake front.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever meet with the American group at No. 107
Fifth avenue?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. 636 Milwaukee avenue was the place mentioned as the
proper place for drilling. Were you ever there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">Pg&nbsp;46</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did they meet more than once there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what the hall is called?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thalia hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you joined this organization did it cost you anything?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ten
cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often did you pay the contributions?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Once a
month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ten cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you joined the armed section did that require any
special contribution?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was Fielden&rsquo;s office in the group of the armed
section?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was Treasurer and Secretary of the organization&mdash;of
the group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he hold any office, or was he simply a private in the
armed section?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He held no office while I attended there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CROSS-EXAMINED.</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Foster:&mdash;&ldquo;Where were you before
you came here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a police officer in England eight years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In uniform?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Part of the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long did you do detective service there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Three
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At what place?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In Lancashire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been with Pinkerton?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Three
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do before you became a detective here?
Were you ever in any legitimate business?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">Pg&nbsp;47</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell&mdash;&ldquo;In any <em>other</em> legitimate business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Witness&mdash;&ldquo;I was storekeeper at the Windsor hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that meeting at Baum&rsquo;s hall a public one?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;March 1 you became a member?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were your antecedents inquired into?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just paid your ten cents and were received?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is not that your experience, that anybody who could pay
10 cents could be received?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anybody excluded?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir, except
reporters. I have seen reporters excluded sometimes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were not reporters generally freely admitted?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not
very often.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had seats for them and a table?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
I never saw more than one at a time there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see anybody excluded by the doorkeeper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever have any ushers&mdash;anybody who got seats for
strangers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but I saw some of the old members get up and
give their seats when strangers came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You stated that Mr. Spies introduced resolutions in sympathy
with a girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody else introduced them but Spies opposed it. He
said there was no use making resolutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is, the girl had had her day in court and it was no use
passing resolutions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said it would be a good opportunity for some one to
take a pistol and go and shoot Wight.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">Pg&nbsp;48</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure Spies said that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote out your report immediately with all the facts
fresh in your mind.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I wrote it that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you write in your report [reading from it] that
Keegan said that after Spies got through with his remarks?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
but Mr. Spies said it also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you show me the place in your report where this is
said?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then your memory is better now than it was immediately
after the meeting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is considerably better now that I have refreshed it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A detective&rsquo;s memory gets better as the time goes on, does
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell objected to this kind of cross-examination.</p>

<p>Referring to the charges against Sergt. Patton, Mr. Foster
asked: &ldquo;Were the circumstances stated that the girl had been
grossly abused, but his brother officers stood round and swore
him out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was it not stated as a general expression that such a
man ought to be shot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may have been.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In regard to the strike at La Salle, Mr. Foster made it appear as
if Parsons had simply stated in general terms that if soap was put on
the rails the train would not be able to move, but that he did not
advise anybody to go and put the soap on. Fielden&rsquo;s remark that
something had been discovered by which the working men could resist
the police and militia, and Parson&rsquo;s remark that he would not
live on <del>snow-balls</del><ins>snowballs</ins> another winter, were
represented by Mr. Foster in an equally innocent and harmless light.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">Pg&nbsp;49</a></span></p>

<p>The cross-examination for the day concluded with the
following questions and answers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard Fielden say: &lsquo;While we march toward the
Board of Trade we will sing the Marseillaise hymn?&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you understood to be the French national hymn?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>W. H. Freeman, a reporter, testified as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at the corner of Randolph and Desplaines streets.
Saw Parsons speaking, and listened to what he had to say.
Some one said Mayor Harrison was there and I tried to find
him. There was a big crowd. Parsons said that Jay Gould
was a robber, and asked what was to be done. Somebody
shouted, &lsquo;Throw him in the lake.&rsquo; Parsons said: &lsquo;No, that
won&rsquo;t do. We must overthrow the system by which he was
enabled to secure so much money.&rsquo; He shouted frequently: &lsquo;To
arms! to arms!&rsquo; and the crowd applauded. There were six or
eight persons on the wagon. Fielden, the next speaker, discussed
legislation, saying that Martin Foran had admitted that
it was impossible for the working men to get their rights through
legislation, and that the people were fools to send such a man to
Congress when he owned that the legislation could not better
them. He justified the forthcoming revolution, saying it was
just as proper as the colonial revolution. The police came up
quietly and my first knowledge of it was the command to disperse.
Then the bomb exploded. It made a terrible noise, and
a moment after the firing commenced. Parsons, Spies and
Fielden were on the wagon, and I think I saw Schwab there.
I crouched down behind the wagon until after the firing was

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">Pg&nbsp;50</a></span>

over; then I went to the Desplaines street station. On getting
out on the street I saw two officers lying wounded. I spoke to
them but they didn&rsquo;t answer, so I told the sergeant of a patrol-wagon
about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Officer McKeogh testified:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was at the Haymarket on the night of May 4. Parsons
followed Spies, saying: &lsquo;I am a Socialist from the top of my
head to the soles of my feet, and I&rsquo;ll express my sentiments if I
die before morning.&rsquo; Again he said: &lsquo;I pay rent for the house
I live in.&rsquo; Some one asked: &lsquo;What does the landlord do with
the money?&rsquo; Parsons replied: &lsquo;I am glad you asked that
question. The landlord pays taxes, they go to pay the sheriff,
the militia, and the Pinkertonites.&rsquo; The crowd cheered, then
Parsons cried: &lsquo;To arms! to arms!&rsquo; and Fielden took the stand.
He said: &lsquo;The law does not protect you, working men. Did
the law protect you when the police shot down your brothers at
McCormick&rsquo;s? Did the law protect you when McCormick closed
the doors of his factory and left you and your wives and children
to starve? I say throttle the law; strangle it, kill it!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>H. E. O. Heineman, formerly a reporter on the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite>, was asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Heineman, you were formerly an Internationalist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you cease your connection with them?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About
two years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom of the defendants do you know that were in that
association or society before you left it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Of my own knowledge
I know none but one, that is Neebe. He used to belong
to the same group that I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever meet with any of the others at any of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">Pg&nbsp;51</a></span>

meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; Spies, Schwab, and I think, Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was about the time Herr Most came here and delivered
some speeches?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it was on account of those speeches you severed your
connection with the Anarchists?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom did you see on the speaker&rsquo;s wagon at the Haymarket?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
saw the speakers, Spies, Schwab and Fielden, and
Rudolph Schnaubelt, whom I had formerly known from my
connection with the Internationalists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say Schnaubelt was on the wagon. How long after
the cloud came up and the crowd thinned out did you see him?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
cannot say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how long before the police came did you miss Schnaubelt?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
cannot say; perhaps ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say Mr. Neebe was a member of the Internationalist
organization. Now, you didn&rsquo;t have any passwords, did you?
It wasn&rsquo;t an organization where you drilled, was it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was
an avowed Socialistic order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another sensational witness was Harry L. Gilmer, a workman,
who testified that he saw Spies and Rudolph Schnaubelt
standing inside the mouth of the alley at the Haymarket; that
Spies lit a match for Schnaubelt, who in turn lit the fuse of the
bomb and threw it among the police. An effort was made to
shake the testimony of this witness, which was not successful,
and witnesses were then brought forward to impeach his veracity,
but the state produced many prominent men who knew
him, and who stated that they would believe him under oath.</p>

<p>Captain Frank Schaack, in charge of the East Chicago
avenue police station, who unearthed the Anarchists&rsquo; conspiracy
after the Haymarket, was called to the stand on Thursday, July

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">Pg&nbsp;52</a></span>

29. Lingg&rsquo;s trunk was placed before him. He was asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know any of the defendants in this case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen Spies, Schwab and Parsons, and Engel and
Lingg were arrested and confined in my station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you first converse with Lingg about this case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About 3 o&rsquo;clock on the afternoon of May 14. First I
asked him his name. He told me. I asked him if he was at the
meeting at 54 Lake street on Tuesday night. He said: &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
Then he said he made dynamite. I asked him what for. He
said: &lsquo;To use then.&rsquo; He looked excited. I asked why he
disliked the police. He said he had a reason; the police clubbed
the men at McCormick&rsquo;s. He said he was down on the police
because they took the part of the capitalists. I said: &lsquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you use guns instead of dynamite?&rsquo; He said guns
wouldn&rsquo;t do; that the militia would outnumber the Socialists.
I asked him how he learned to make dynamite. He said out of
books, and that he made bombs out of gas-pipe and out of lead
and metal mixed. He said he got the lead on the streets and
the gas-pipe along the river or anywhere he could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What other conversation did you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lingg said he made those bombs and meant to use them.
Then Mrs. Seliger accused him of making bombs a few weeks
after he came to her house. I knew then that he had made a
good many. John Thielen was arrested at the same time, and
from him we got two bombs. I said to Lingg: &lsquo;This man
says you gave him the bombs. What have you to say?&rsquo; He
looked at Thielen and shook his head, and Thielen said: &lsquo;Oh,
it&rsquo;s no use, everything is known; you might just as well talk.&rsquo;
But Lingg refused to say anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">Pg&nbsp;53</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this trunk here was brought to my office. Under the
lining I found a lot of dynamite and some fuse and asked him
if that was the kind of dynamite he used. He said it was; that
he got it at a store on Lake street. There were three kinds of
dynamite. He said he experimented once with a long bomb;
that he put it in a tree, touched it off, and that it riddled the
tree to atoms. I asked him if he knew Spies. He said &lsquo;Yes,
for some time;&rsquo; that he was often at the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office.
I asked him how long he had been a Socialist. He said he&rsquo;d
been a Socialist as long as he could think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have any conversation with Engel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, on the 18th, in the evening, I asked him where he was May
3. He said he worked for a man named Koch. I asked him if he made
a speech at the meeting at 54 Lake street. He said no, but that he
was at the meeting. The second time I talked with him his wife came.
She brought him a bunch of flowers. He got excited, and cried: &lsquo;What
good are those flowers to me? Here I am locked up in a dark cell.&rsquo;
Then his wife said: &lsquo;Papa, see what trouble you&rsquo;ve got yourself
into; why haven&rsquo;t you stopped this nonsense?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;Mamma, I
can&rsquo;t. I am cursed with eloquence. What is in a man must come out.
<del>Louis</del><ins>Louise</ins> Michel suffered for the cause. She is
a woman; why should I not suffer? I am a man, and I will stand it like
a man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many bombs in all did you find?&rdquo;&mdash;Objected to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the jury what experiments you made with those
bombs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One bomb found in Lingg&rsquo;s room, which Schuettler said
was loaded with a funnel, I put in a box two feet square and
buried in the ground three feet deep at Lake View. Officers

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">Pg&nbsp;54</a></span>

Stift, Rehm and Loewenstein were there. We touched the
bomb off. It blew the box to pieces, fragments carried off the
branches of trees, and the ground was torn up for a great distance.
This black dynamite, also found in Lingg&rsquo;s room, was
put in a beer keg. Part of this dynamite Lingg gave to Thielen,
and this is a fragment of a round bomb I experimented with.
On top of this bomb I had a round piece of iron thirty-four
inches wide, some heavy planks, a piece of steel forty-two inches
wide and weighing 180 pounds; then an iron boiler twenty-two
inches wide and fourteen inches high; then on top of that a
stone weighing 132 pounds. The stone was burst to pieces, nine
holes were shot through the iron boiler, the steel cover was
cracked, and the planks were split into kindling wood. Portions
of the other bombs I cut off, and gave them to Profs.
Haines and Paton.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were bushels of bombs before the jury. Coils of
fuse was unwound. Dynamite in paper packages and in tin
boxes was displayed. The court<del>-</del>room looked like the interior of
an arsenal so far as the tremendous character of the explosives
were concerned. Pieces of metal, gas-pipe, tin cans, and iron
boxes rattled together. Capt. Schaack, pointing to the bombs,
said he got two from Hoffman, one from fireman Miller, and one
from Officer Loewenstein. He was not allowed to tell how
many bombs in all he received until the officers first told where
the bombs were found.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now about those conversations. Did Lingg say anything
about the use of those bombs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said he intended to use them against the Gatling-guns
of the militia; that a revolution was impending. I asked him
about that satchel he brought to Neff&rsquo;s place. He said he saw

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">Pg&nbsp;55</a></span>

one there. Then I asked him where he got the moulds to mould
the round bombs. He said he made them out of clay; that they
could be used about two times, then they were no good. He
said he saw the &lsquo;Revenge&rsquo; circular on the West side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did he say was at his place May 4?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He said about
six in all, but he only knew the two Lehmans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Capt. Schaack was asked by Mr. Ingham whether he experimented
with fuse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did. I also experimented with dynamite cartridges. I
had one inserted into a stone weighing perhaps thirty pounds.
The explosion broke this stone into atoms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cross-examined by Mr. Foster.&mdash;&ldquo;What Lingg said to you,
Captain, was substantially this: That there was to be a conflict
between the police and the Gatling-guns on one side and the
laboring men on the other, and that he was making these bombs
to use when that time came?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s about it, only he said the time had actually come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those experiments you made were made for your own satisfaction?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were made to enable me to testify to the character of
the stuff that was found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact you woke up Engel in his cell after
midnight to interrogate him, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t remember. If I did, I did, and I suppose I
did. I had a right to do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know of two detectives at your station who went
to Lingg&rsquo;s cell late at night and exhibited a rope saying they
were going to hang him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not, and I do not believe anything of the kind was
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">Pg&nbsp;56</a></span></p>

<p>Officer Hoffman, of the Larrabee street station, testified that
he found nine round bombs and four long ones under a sidewalk
near Clyde street and Clybourn avenue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was with you at the time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Gustav Lehman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under John Thielen&rsquo;s house the witness found two long
bombs, two boxes of cartridges, two cigar boxes full of dynamite,
one rifle, and one revolver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lehman pointed out to me a can holding
about a gallon, and this was filled with dynamite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at this box of caps. Where did you find them?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
were with the dynamite. They were all under the sidewalk
on Clybourn avenue, back of Ogden&rsquo;s grove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Frank Walker opened the proceedings
Friday, July 30, by reading extracts from Parsons&rsquo;
<cite>Alarm</cite>, dated May 2d of this year. It was a speech delivered
by Parsons April 29, the night the new Board of Trade was dedicated,
and that occasion afforded the speaker his subject. The
speech was full of rabid utterances, of which the following are
samples:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To-night the property owners are dedicating a temple for
the plunder of the people. We assemble as Anarchists and
Communists to protest against the system of society founded on
spoilation of the people.&rdquo; In conclusion Parsons advised his
hearers to save their money and buy revolvers and rifles, and
recommended the use of dynamite.</p>

<p>Under date of December 26, 1885, the <cite>Alarm</cite> contained a
long description of what qualities should center in a revolutionist.
&ldquo;The revolutionist,&rdquo; it was said, &ldquo;must dedicate his life exclusively
to his idea, living in this world only for the purpose of
more surely destroying it. He hates every law and science, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">Pg&nbsp;57</a></span>

knows of but one science&mdash;that of destruction. He despises
public sentiment and social morality. All his sentiments of
friendship, love and sympathy must be suppressed. Equally
must he hate everything that stands in the way to the attainment
of his ends. He must have but one thought&mdash;merciless
revolution; he must be bound by no ties, and must not hesitate
to destroy all institutions and systems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On February 6, 1886, the <cite>Alarm</cite> paid its respects to Captain
Bonfield, and the attention of the revolutionists was called
to the clubbing done by the police at the time of the car-men&rsquo;s
strike, by saying: &ldquo;American sovereigns, if you don&rsquo;t like this,
get guns or dynamite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The names of those appointed to act as a bureau of information
for the Anarchists were printed in the <cite>Alarm</cite> under date
January 9, 1886. Joseph Bock, B. Rau, August Spies, A. R.
Parsons and Anton Hirschberger were the names given. On
March 20, 1886, the <cite>Alarm</cite> said: &ldquo;All argument is no good
unless based on force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On another occasion, speaking of the eight-hour movement,
it was said: &ldquo;All roads lead to Rome; so must all labor movements
lead to Socialism.&rdquo; Later the <cite>Alarm</cite> said: &ldquo;One pound
of dynamite is better than a bushel of ballots. Working men,
to arms! Death to luxurious idleness!&rdquo; All articles from
which these extracts were taken had Parsons&rsquo; name appended as
the writer. April 24, the date of the last issue of the <cite>Alarm</cite>,
the Knights of Labor were assailed &ldquo;for attempting to prevent
the people from exterminating the predatory beasts&mdash;the capitalists.&rdquo;
Mr. Ingham reads from Herr Most&rsquo;s book a description
of an infernal machine to burn down buildings. This apparatus
is described as of wonderful efficiency and dirt cheap. It

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">Pg&nbsp;58</a></span>

is read to secure the admission as evidence of the four tin boxes
spoken of by Detective Jansen, who saw them exhibited at 54
West Lake street.</p>

<p>The Court is not sure the contents in both cases are the same,
and Officer Coughlin, of the Chicago avenue station, is put on
the stand to prove the character of the compound. He experimented
with one can by means of a fulminating cap. He tried
to explode the can but failed, then he attached a fuse and an explosion
followed. A quantity of burning liquid, much resembling
vitriol, was distributed in all directions, a stream was thrown
five or six feet high, and for a space of ten feet in all directions
the grass was set on fire, and it burned for fully five minutes.</p>

<p>Charles B. Prouty is called. He was formerly manager of a
gun store on State street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen any of the defendants before?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
have seen Engel and Parsons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you converse with Engel last, before May 4?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Some
time last fall. Mr. Engel and his wife called at the
store and inquired for some big revolvers. They found one that
suited them, to present to some society. They said they wanted
100 or 200 for this society. A week later they said this revolver
would do and they wanted some 200 revolvers. I told them
I thought I could get them, but when they came back the second
time I found I couldn&rsquo;t. They were much disappointed and
said they would go some place else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the price?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I think $5.50. They were either
44 or 45 calibre revolvers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say about the price?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I told them that
was very cheap and said they could make a handsome profit on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">Pg&nbsp;59</a></span>

them. They said they didn&rsquo;t want to make any profit; that the
weapons were for a society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Black, on the cross-examination, brings it out that
the witness sold the gun to Engel, thinking he wanted to go into
some speculation.</p>

<p>W. J. Reynolds, also in the gun business at 73 State street,
has seen Parsons, and he thinks Engel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see Parsons relative to your
<del>buisness</del><ins>business</ins>, and tell what it was?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it was in February or March. He came into the
store and wanted to purchase about forty remodeled Remington
guns. Parsons spoke to me several times about this purchase,
but it was never made. Parsons seemed undecided.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;State whether your concern ever sold any rifle or revolver
cartridges, which were to be delivered, and were delivered, at
636 Milwaukee avenue&mdash;Thalia hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question is overruled by the court unless the cartridges
were delivered by the witness in person. Capt. Black takes the
witness in hand and he said he never knew Parsons by name until
yesterday, then that person was pointed out to him in court.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; says Capt. Black.&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Reynolds,&rdquo; says Mr.
Grinnell, &ldquo;was Parsons pointed out to you, or did you not point
out the man you had seen before?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pointed out the man I had seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A manuscript in Spies&rsquo; handwriting is offered in evidence.
It is a manuscript of an editorial which was printed in the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite> of May 4 and captioned: &ldquo;Blood and Powder as
a Cure for Dissatisfied Working Men.&rdquo; In another part of the
paper was the following: &ldquo;This evening there is a great meeting
at the Haymarket. No working men ought to stay away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Manuscript in Schwab&rsquo;s handwriting is submitted. This
matter appeared in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> May 4, and one passage
is as follows: &ldquo;The heroes of the club dispensed with their
cudgels yesterday.&rdquo; This has reference to the riot at McCormick&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Another extract; &ldquo;Reports of the capitalist papers have all
been dictated by the police.&rdquo; Still another: &ldquo;The armory on
the Lake front is guarded by military tramps.&rdquo; And another:
&ldquo;Milwaukee, usually so quiet, yesterday became the scene of
quite a number of labor riots.&rdquo; Under date of May 3, Spies&rsquo;
paper said: &ldquo;A hot conflict. The termination of the radical
elements bring the extortioners in numerous instances to terms.&rdquo;
January 5, 1885, Spies wrote concerning a report of a meeting
at 54 West Lake street: &ldquo;Comrade Spies, in the course of his
speech said: &lsquo;And if we commence to murder we obey the law
of necessity for self-preservation.&rsquo;&rdquo; January 19, 1885, the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite> contained a two column report of a meeting held
at Mueller&rsquo;s hall. Dynamite, blood and bombs were the nice
points dealt with, and the comments thereon was what the state
wanted read. But first a translation should have been made,
and to do this an adjournment is taken until 2 o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>As the trial progressed public interest in the development of
the Anarchist plot to overthrow law and order increased. The
courtroom would not hold half of the people that applied for admission,
and hundreds were turned away. Scattered throughout
the courtroom were numerous red flags and banners of the Lehr
und Wehr Verein and the various Anarchist groups. Detective
James Bonfield was recalled to identify the flags and banners
found at the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office. They were as follows:
&ldquo;In the Absence of Law all Men are Free&rdquo;; &ldquo;Every Government

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">Pg&nbsp;61</a></span>

is a Conspiracy against the People&rdquo;; &ldquo;Down with all
Laws&rdquo;; &ldquo;Fifteenth Section Boys Stick together&rdquo;; &ldquo;Proletarians
of all Countries, unite&rdquo;; &ldquo;International Working People&rsquo;s Association
of Chicago. Presented by the Socialistic Women&rsquo;s Society
July 16, 1875&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 31, the state introduced more translations
from the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>. The paper of January 6, under the
caption of &ldquo;A New Military Law,&rdquo; contained the following editorials:
&ldquo;After the adoption of the law and its working we
have learned a lesson. The vote of 1881 has shown that we are
stronger than ever. There exists to-day an invisible network of
Socialistic forces. We are stronger than ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On January 22, 1886, an editorial asked: &ldquo;How can the
eight-hour day be brought about? Why, every clear-headed
man can see that the result can be obtained by no other means
than armed force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day it was said: &ldquo;The rottenness of our social institutions
cannot be covered up with whitewash. Capital sucks
its force out of the labor of the working men. The misery has
become unbearable. Let us not treat with our enemies on May
1. Therefore, comrades, arm to the teeth. We want to demand
our rights on May 1.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Regarding the riot in London, a meeting was held at the
Twelfth street Turner hall, Neebe presiding; Fielden the orator,
and his speech and the proceedings were reported under date of
February 15. Fielden said: &ldquo;The time is not so far distant
when the down-trodden in Chicago will rise like their brothers
in London, and march up Michigan avenue, the red flag at their
head.&rdquo; Schwab spoke, calling on the people to rally around the
red flag of revolution. An editorial on February 17 said:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">Pg&nbsp;62</a></span>

&ldquo;Hundreds and thousands of reasons indicate that force will
bring about a successful termination in the struggle for liberty.&rdquo;
April 10 it was said: &ldquo;What happened yesterday in East St.
Louis may happen in Chicago. It is high time to be prepared
to complete the ammunition and be ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On April 22 Spies wrote: &ldquo;Working men, arm yourselves.
May 1 is close at hand.&rdquo; Six days later he said: &ldquo;What Anarchists
predicted six months ago has been realized now. The
power of the manufacturers must be met with armed working
men. The logic of facts requires this. Arms are more necessary
now than ever. It is time to arm yourselves. Whoever
has not money sell your watch and buy firearms. Patience has
been preached&mdash;the working men have had too much of patience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On April 29 Spies wrote: &ldquo;The wage slave who is not utterly
demoralized should have a breech-loader in his house.&rdquo;
And the next day he said: &ldquo;As we have been informed the
police have received secret orders to keep themselves in readiness
for fear of a riot on Saturday next, to the working men we again
say: Arm yourselves! Keep your arms hidden so that they
will not be stolen by the minions of the law, as has happened
before.&rdquo; In the Letter-Box was the following: &ldquo;A dynamite
cartridge explodes not through concussion. A percussion primer
is necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>January 5, in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, a report said: &ldquo;The
meeting which the American group held at 54 West Lake street
was one of the best meetings ever held in Chicago. Comrade
Spies said: &lsquo;When we murder we put an end to general murder.
We only follow the law of self-preservation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>On January 18 all working men were called to attend a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">Pg&nbsp;63</a></span>

meeting at Steinmetz hall. &ldquo;To Arms,&rdquo; was the caption.
&ldquo;Those who desire instruction in drilling will not have to pay.&rdquo;
At Mueller&rsquo;s hall, a few days later, Schwab made an address,
saying: &ldquo;We have made all preparations for a revolution by
force.&rdquo; Spies said: &ldquo;I have been accused by a paper that I
tried to stir up a revolution. I concede this. What is crime,
anyhow? When the working men try to secure the fruits of
their labor it is called crime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Guns, dynamite and prussic acid, Spies preached, should be
given the working men, and &ldquo;for every clubbed head in the
ranks of the working men there should be exacted twelve dead
policemen.&rdquo; In a long discourse on the means of action, Spies
said: &ldquo;In the action itself one must be personally at the place,
to select personally that point of the place of action which is the
most important, and is coupled with the greatest danger, upon
which depends chiefly the success or failure of the whole affair.
Otherwise the thing would reach the long ears of the police,
which, as is known to every one, hear the grass grow and the
fleas cough; but if this theory is acted on, the danger of discovery
is extremely small.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Love of Self-Sacrifice&rdquo;, as manifested
by those who were killed during the uprising of the Paris
Commune, while fighting under the red flag, was the subject of
a long address on March 22, and March 23 it was said the question
of arming was the one uppermost in labor circles. Working
men, it was held, ought to be armed long ago. Daggers and
revolvers were easily purchased; hand-grenades were plentiful,
and so was dynamite. The approaching contest should not
be gone into with empty hands.</p>

<p>The State here rested its case.</p>

</div>

<p class="chapsum">Under a cloud. A struggle for life. Contesting every
point by shrewd counsel. Braving it out.
The defense.</p>

<p>Attorney Zeisler moved to have the jury sent from the room
pending a motion, and this the Court refused to do, saying it
was a vicious practice, and that the jury should hear all there
was in a case.</p>

<p>Capt. Black&mdash;&ldquo;The motion we desire to make is that your
Honor now instruct the jury, the State having rested, that they
find a verdict of not guilty as to Oscar Neebe; and we desire to
argue that motion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Counsel for the defense proceeded to argue the motion, and
held that Neebe was not amenable; not having been present at
the Haymarket, and having nothing to do with the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite> until after the arrest of Spies.</p>

<p>The Court&mdash;&ldquo;If he had had prior knowledge of the
participation in the Haymarket meeting the question would be quite
different, but if there is a general advice to commit murder, and the
time and occasion not being <del>forseen</del><ins>foreseen</ins>,
the adviser is guilty if the murder is committed. Whether he did
participate, concurred, assented, or encouraged the publication of the
<cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> is a question for this jury upon the
testimony that he was frequently there, and that so soon as Schwab and
Spies were away he took charge. Everything in which his name has been
mentioned must be taken together, and then what the proper inference
is, is for the jury to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Capt. Black&mdash;&ldquo;Does your Honor overrule the motion?&rdquo;&mdash;The
Court&mdash;&ldquo;I overrule the motion.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/z073.jpg" width="416" height="345"
        alt="Counsel for Defendants" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Counsel for Defendants.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">Pg&nbsp;65</a></span></p>

<p>Capt. Black&mdash;&ldquo;We except, if your Honor pleases. We desire
also to make a like motion, without arguing it, in behalf of
all the defendants except Spies and Fischer.&rdquo;&mdash;Motion overruled.</p>

<p>Mr. Salomon then began the opening argument for the defense.
There were two leading points in his argument:</p>

<p>1. There <del>connot</del><ins>cannot</ins> be accessories without
a principal. The state must prove that somebody was a principal in
committing murder before it can convict others as accessories.</p>

<p>2. The defendants did not throw the bomb: therefore they
are not guilty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True, the defendants made bombs; true, they intended to
use dynamite. What if they did?&rdquo; asks Mr. Salomon. &ldquo;They
were preparing for a revolution by force of arms and by means
of dynamite&mdash;but what has that to do with the case? Did they
kill Matthias J. Degan, for which act they were specifically indicted?
That is the question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Salomon then argued that the State would have to prove
that the object of the Haymarket meeting was to &ldquo;aggressively
kill the police.&rdquo; He pointed out that the defendants had consecrated
their lives to the benefit of their fellow men. They did
not seek McCormick&rsquo;s property for themselves&mdash;they did not
want the goods in Marshall Field&rsquo;s store for themselves. Their
methods were dangerous, but why were they not stopped at inception?
They advocated force, because they believed in force.
No twelve men&mdash;no 12,000 men&mdash;could root out Anarchy. Anarchy
is of the head&mdash;it is implanted in the soul! As well attempt
to root out Republicanism or Democracy! They intended
revolution&mdash;a revolution similar to that of the Northern
states against slavery, or of America against British oppression.
They wanted to free the white slaves&mdash;the working classes.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">Pg&nbsp;66</a></span>

They intended to use dynamite in furtherance of that revolution.
But they did not expect, nor did they conspire to take, the life
of officer Degan. Lingg had the right to manufacture bombs
and fill his house with dynamite, if he so pleased. There was
no law against it. Mr. Salomon intimated that an attempt
would be made to show who threw the bomb, or that it was
thrown by somebody other than Schnaubelt; also that the police
began the riot by shooting into the crowd; that Schwab was not
at the meeting at all, and that when the bomb exploded Parsons
and Fischer were in Zephf&rsquo;s hall drinking beer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We expect further to show you,&rdquo; said Mr. Salomon, &ldquo;that
this meeting had assembled peaceably, that its objects were
peaceable, that they delivered the same harangues, that the
crowd listened quietly, that not a single act transpired there previous
to the coming of the police, for which any man in it could
be held amenable to law. They assembled there under the provisions
of our Constitution in the exercise of their right of free
speech, to discuss the situation of the working men, to discuss
the eight-hour question. They assembled there and incidentally
discussed what they called the outrages perpetrated at McCormick&rsquo;s.
No man expected that bomb would be thrown, no man
expected that any one would be injured at that meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The witness who gave, perhaps, the strongest evidence for
the defense was Dr. James D. Taylor, an aged physician of the
Eclectic school. On the direct examination, Captain Black
asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo; Answer&mdash;&ldquo;I am seventy-six years of
age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were you on May 4, in the evening?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At the
Haymarket.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">Pg&nbsp;67</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us when you reached the Haymarket.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About
twenty minutes before the speaking commenced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;During that twenty minutes where were you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was
standing in the alley&mdash;Crane&rsquo;s alley&mdash;near Desplaines street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How near to the west edge of the sidewalk?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Very
close to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long did you occupy that position?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;As long as
the bullets would let me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long was that?&rdquo; asks Mr. Grinnell.&mdash;&ldquo;I was the last
man that left the alley after the bomb exploded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the speeches at the Haymarket?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, yes;
distinctly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Spies say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He spoke about Jay Gould, and
some one said: &lsquo;Hang him,&rsquo; and Spies said: &lsquo;No, it is not
time for that.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Parsons say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He spoke of the necessity for
union. The substance of his remarks was that if the working
men expected to win they must unite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the approach of the police?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did; the
first column came up close to where I was standing. They were
so close I could touch them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear Fielden?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, he spoke about the law, and
said: &lsquo;It is your enemy. Kill it, stab it, throttle it; if you
don&rsquo;t, it will throttle you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the command given to disperse?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Fielden say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;We are peaceable,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;This is a peaceable meeting.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Fielden again?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did. He got down out

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">Pg&nbsp;68</a></span>

of the wagon and came around where I was standing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him with a revolver?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him shoot at all?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Never. I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the bomb?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About twenty feet, or perhaps
forty, south of the alley, behind some boxes on the sidewalk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, tell what you saw.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, the bomb looked to me
like a boy&rsquo;s firecracker. It was then about five feet in the air.
It circled in a southeast direction, and fell, I think, between the
first and second columns of the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did the shooting commence?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Almost simultaneously.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the firing proceed <del>frrom</del><ins>from</ins> the crowd,
or the police?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It came from the street, near where the police
were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see or hear of any pistol shots from the crowd?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you went to the Haymarket the next morning.
Did you make any examination of the neighborhood?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you find any marks of bullets in the walls around
there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, a great many. They were in the north end of
the wall of Crane Bros.&rsquo; building. Then I examined a telegraph
pole north of the alley, on the west side of the street. There
were a great many perforations on the south side of this pole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were there any perforations on the north side of the pole?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you visit the place a second time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the purpose of examining this telegraph pole?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">Pg&nbsp;69</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell the jury whether you found the pole there or not.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
was not there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the pole was gone?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What course did you take, doctor, in going out of the alley?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
took a zig-zag course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doctor, are you a Socialist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you an Anarchist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not in the sense in which the
term is usually employed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a Socialist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About fifty
years. I was taught Socialism by Robert Owen, father of Robert
Dale Owen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know any of the defendants?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I know
Parsons and Fielden well; Spies and Neebe slightly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever taken part in Socialistic meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.
I have spoken at meetings controversially.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you, or were you, a member of the International
Working Men&rsquo;s Society?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I continued a member until the
organization was abandoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What group were you a member of?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Of the American
group.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you attend meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At Greif&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were the conditions of membership? Tell the jury
whether those meetings were secret or public.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They were
public. The conditions of membership were&mdash;&rdquo; This answer
was objected to by the State, and the Court sustains the objection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a member of the American
group?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I think a year, or a little more.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">Pg&nbsp;70</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;How often have you met Parsons and Fielden?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
have not been regular in their attendance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, taking them in their order, will you state what you
heard them say, either on the Lake front or at any hall, regarding
the use of force?&rdquo; Captain Black withdraws this question
at once upon consultation with his associates.</p>

<p>Mr. Ingham then took up the cross-examination: &ldquo;How
did you come to go to the Haymarket, doctor?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I happened
to be in the neighborhood, taking my usual evening walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see any circular?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to attend the meeting, then?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
saw a great many people, who told me there was to be a
meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you go at once to the alley?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you did not stop on the Haymarket?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am
sure I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, did you go in the alley?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To hear what was
to be said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did you get there?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A little after 7 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you stopped there all the time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long did you wait?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the meeting was opened?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you listened to Spies?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The substance of what he said was
that the men had better go home, and not do any violence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(The witness confounds Spies and Parsons. The former,
according to other witnesses, made no reference to Jay Gould,
but Parsons did. The doctor said also that Parsons told the
men that the history of strikes showed all strikes to have proved
a failure; that what was wanted was a change in the system.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">Pg&nbsp;71</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Fielden all the time he was speaking?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he had no revolver?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He had not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you keep your eye on him all the time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Every
minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not take your eye off him for a single minute?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not
half a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you saw him just as he closed his speech?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.
He got down out of the wagon and was standing close to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did he go after the bomb exploded?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord
only knows what became of him. The demoralization was so
great that I don&rsquo;t know. I think he was one of the first men to
go down after the shell exploded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how long did you remain there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was the last
man to go up the alley. There was a great crowd ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were the bullets thick?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I should say they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you didn&rsquo;t run?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I am an old man, and I
don&rsquo;t care much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do next, after leaving the alley?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I went
farther down in the alley. I was the last man to go down the
alley. There was a projection in the alley and I took refuge behind
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were young enough then to want to live?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
wasn&rsquo;t that; I heard the police shooting. They were going back
toward the Haymarket. I could tell that by the report of the
shooting. Then I ran out on Desplaines street and dodged
about till I got home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you dodge?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A good many places. The
police were shooting all over. They were all excited. I saw
them shooting as far up as Madison street. One policeman on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">Pg&nbsp;72</a></span>

Madison street I saw point his revolver at a crowd of people on
the street and say: &lsquo;D&mdash; you! you&rsquo;ve got to die any way.&rsquo;
Then he fired his revolver at them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you saw the bomb when it was about five feet in
the air?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did <del>yon</del><ins>you</ins> see the fuse?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a bomb was it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Round.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened after it exploded?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The demoralization
was great.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear any groans?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a physician?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Forty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What school?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Eclectic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you a graduate of any college?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; Eclectic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You say you are a Socialist, but not an Anarchist as it is
commonly defined. Are you an Anarchist as you understand
that term?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in an oath?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that an oath adds anything to the obligation
to tell the truth?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No. All honest men should tell the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>L. M. Moses, a grocer, and Austin Mitchell, who lived with
Moses, testified that they would not believe the witness Gilmer
under oath. The defense then introduced August Krumm, of
1036 West Twentieth street, a woodworker, by whom they expected
to entirely offset Gilmer&rsquo;s evidence. From his evidence
it was made to appear that Gilmer mistook Krumm for Spies,
and that instead of lighting a bomb Krumm was engaged in
nothing more harmful than lighting a pipe of tobacco. Mr. Foster
conducts the examination, and the witness says he was at the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">Pg&nbsp;73</a></span>

Haymarket meeting May 4, and saw Spies and Parsons there for
the first time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to go there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I had business down
town; heard of the meeting and went there with a friend, A. M.
Albright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how close to the alley near Crane Brothers did you
stand?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Very close. We stood there all the time from about
9.30 o&rsquo;clock until the police arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you stand there all the time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No; we were gone
for a minute or two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you go?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;We went into the alley. I
wanted to light my pipe. Albright came with me. He gave
me a pipeful of tobacco and I went into the alley to light my
pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you go into the alley for?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There was a wind
on the street, and we went into the alley so the match would
not go out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Albright followed you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. He came to light
his pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose pipe was lighted first?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then his pipe was lighted?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. He came over to me
and lit his pipe from the match that lit my pipe, holding his
head up close to mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you came out of the alley what did you see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The
police were there; then the explosion followed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Spies go into the alley?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see anybody in the alley?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. There were
two or three men there, but I could not tell who they were. It
was dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">Pg&nbsp;74</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did anybody come into the alley while you were there?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could anybody pass into the alley without your knowing
it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir; I stood up close to the building while I was
lighting my pipe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, tell whether you saw a light in the air about that
time or a little after.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; I saw a light like a match about
twenty feet south of the alley on Desplaines street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell takes the witness in hand. &ldquo;You say you
came down town on business. Who did you want to see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;A
friend of mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Adolph Winness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where does he work?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he work at?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He is a woodworker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you expect to meet him then, if you did not know
where he lived or where he worked?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He told me I could
find him there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Find him where?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;On Randolph street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see him last?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That afternoon. He came
out to see me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And he did not tell you where he worked?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor where he stopped?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet he said you could find him on Randolph street?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he gave you the idea that he could be found out of
doors, did he?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s around Randolph street a good
deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you meet Albright?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In the alley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near Crane Brothers?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">Pg&nbsp;75</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I said: &lsquo;Hello, Albright,&rsquo; and he
said: &lsquo;Hello, Krumm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Did you say you came down town to see a
friend?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him the name of your friend?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was speaking then?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell what he said.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He said something about Jay
Gould.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Spies say?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;A few words more,
boys, and we&rsquo;ll go home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spies said that, did he?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which man is Spies?&rdquo;&mdash;The witness confounds the men.
Asked to indicate Spies he points to Fielden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you stand in the alley when the speaking was
going on?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I had my back to the north wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you stand that way all the time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, except
when we lit our pipes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then did you stand the same way after you lighted your
pipes?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then how could you see these men if you had your backs
to the wall?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I looked over my head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You looked over your head all the time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, when
we looked at the speakers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never saw these men before?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet from that point in the alley, the speakers eight feet or
more distant, a crowd between you, you looking over your
shoulders in the dark, you recognize these men the first time you
saw them?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where were the police when Fielden said. &lsquo;Now, a word

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">Pg&nbsp;76</a></span>

more boys, and we will go home&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They were coming up
Desplaines street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was Spies then?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t you see Spies on the wagon?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think now. Early in the evening, I
think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, when you were talking to Albright, did you talk
about what the speakers were saying?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you talk about the eight-hour question?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were you talking about?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, where did you see the bomb?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was about ten
feet in the air, about twenty feet south of the alley. I didn&rsquo;t
see it explode.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, of course not. It was too far south.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There then was some boxes on the sidewalk, and you
couldn&rsquo;t see?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not say there were any boxes on the
sidewalk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if there were any boxes there you would have
seen them?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I would have seen them if they had been
on the sidewalk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you did not see them there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(All the other witnesses for the defense testified that a big
pile of boxes stood on the sidewalk between the alley and a
point where the bomb exploded.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you say you did not see those boxes?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When were you at the Haymarket?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;May 4.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you ever there in your life?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about a lamp post. Did you see one?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">Pg&nbsp;77</a></span>

remember now, but I know there is one at the southeast corner
of the alley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I worked at the corner of
Randolph and Jefferson streets for ten years, and remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long ago was that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can remember that a lamp post stood at the
southeast corner of the alley after the lapse of seven years?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your wife now?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Living on Sedgwick street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I have not seen her for
a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to go to Salomon &amp; Zeisler&rsquo;s office?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
saw a notice in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> asking for all that knew
anything about the bomb-throwing to call on them. I went
there on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see this notice?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Some time ago. I don&rsquo;t
remember when.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you talk with any one about this bomb-throwing?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
with Albright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any one else?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet you saw the bomb in the air and heard the explosion
but you did not talk to any one about what you saw?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M. T. Malkoff, the correspondent of a paper at Moscow,
Russia, and formerly a writer on the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, testified
that Parsons was in Zephf&rsquo;s hall, talking to his wife, Mrs.
Holmes and the witness, when the bomb exploded. State&rsquo;s Attorney
Grinnell elicits from the witness that he has been five
years in this country, that he lived in New York and maintained
himself by teaching the Russian Language. From New York,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">Pg&nbsp;78</a></span>

he went to Little Rock, then to St. Louis, and finally to Chicago,
arriving here in 1884. &ldquo;You came here with a letter of introduction
to Spies?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir. I obtained my position in the
South through a letter of introduction from Spies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to get that letter?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I and a man
named Clossie translated a romance from the Russian and sold
it to Spies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a revolutionary novel?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was not. It was a
description&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to go into that. You know Herr Most?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
have seen him, but I don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Justus Schwab? You had letters sent to his
address?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lived with Schwab in New York?&ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lived with Balthazar Rau here, though, on May 4?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;At 418 Larrabee street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you leave Russia?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In 1882.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bedroom was searched, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were the arms found there guns and bayonets, or any of
them, belonging to you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you live before you went to Rau&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;With
Mr. Schwab.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of the defendants?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a stockholder in the <cite>Alarm</cite> company?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You contributed money to that organization?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That
may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But did you not contribute money?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Two dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">Pg&nbsp;79</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You were a Nihilist in Russia?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not the agent here for the Nihilists in Russia?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No,
sir. I am not an agent for any society in Russia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you not tell Mr. Hardy you were the agent for a Nihilistic
society?&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo;No, sir. The reporters used to call me a
Nihilist because I was Russian.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What paper are you now working for?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The <cite>Moscow
Gazette</cite>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at that letter; is that your signature at the bottom?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter is written in German and it is given to the translator,
who is instructed to render it into English. &ldquo;This letter
is directed to a &lsquo;Mr. Editor.&rsquo; What editor?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I think it was
directed to Mr. Spies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was before you came to Chicago?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we offer it in evidence.&rdquo; The letter is, in substance,
an inquiry as to whether or not Spies could use certain articles
written by Malkoff. It goes on to say: &ldquo;I have just completed
another article treating of the secret revolutionary societies of
Russia. I am a proletariat in the fullest sense of the word.
Address your letter to J. H. Schwab, 50 First street, New York.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that J. H. Schwab, Justus Schwab?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you live with him in New York?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir. I just
got my mail there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Foster, &ldquo;you say you were a proletariat. What
do you mean by that term?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I understand it to be a man
without any means of support.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you, having no money, had your mail sent to Justus
Schwab because you had no home, eh?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; asked Mr. Ingham, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you if you did not use

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">Pg&nbsp;80</a></span>

the term proletariat in the sense in which Socialists always employ
that term?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir, I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>SAMUEL FIELDEN.</p>

<p>Samuel Fielden, one of the defendants who was speaking at
the time of the bomb explosion, testified that he did not know
who threw the bomb, and denied that he fired at the police with
a revolver. He was cross-examined by Mr. Ingham for the
State, who asked: &ldquo;At what age did you come to the United
States?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Twenty-one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have any business before you came to the United
States?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I went to work in a cotton mill at eight years of
age, and worked in that mill until I left the country to come to
the United States.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a Socialist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I joined the
<del>Socialiastic</del><ins>Socialistic</ins> organization in July,
1884.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been a revolutionist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In the sense
of an evolutionary revolutionist, I have been so for a number of
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been of the belief that the existing
order of things should be overthrown by force?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know that I have ever been convinced. I am of the opinion
that the existing order of things must be overturned, but
whether by force I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you believed in Anarchy?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I believed
in it shortly after I joined the organization&mdash;as soon as
I came to think on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have been progressing from Socialism to Anarchism;
and if you cannot convince the majority of the United States to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">Pg&nbsp;81</a></span>

your opinions, you propose to compel them by force?&rdquo;&mdash;Objected to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you preached Anarchy?&rdquo;&mdash;Objected to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there any English-speaking group in the city that you
know of?&rdquo;&mdash;Objected to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever attend any meeting of any English-speaking
group other than the American group in this city of that kind?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;We
tried to found one a year ago last winter on West Indiana
street. I think we only held two meetings, and then we
abandoned it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any other group of them that you attended?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
remember any now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have for the last two or three years been making
speeches of Socialistic and Anarchistic character?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I have
been making labor speeches; they were not always Socialistic or
Anarchistic speeches.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you have made Socialistic and Anarchistic speeches?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
I have touched on Anarchy and Socialism, and sometimes
my speeches might have been considered from the ordinary
trades union standpoint, for all the anarchy there was in them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever made speeches on the Lake front and other
Socialistic meetings?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, on the Lake front, some on Market
square, Twelfth street, Turner hall, and at No. 106 Randolph
street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the copy of the <cite>Alarm</cite> of June 27, 1885, &lsquo;Dynamite;
Instructions Regarding Its Use and Operation,&rsquo; and signed
&lsquo;A. S.&rsquo; Say whether you ever saw it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there any reason why you did not walk when you

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">Pg&nbsp;82</a></span>

started home that night?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I did not wish to be arrested
that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You expected that you would be arrested?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, after
that trouble I expected to be arrested.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<del>Wou</del><ins>You</ins> were speaking when the police came
up, and were making no inflammatory speech?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not incite
anybody to do anything, to do any overt act. I told the people in
general to resist the present socialistic system that oppressed them,
and gave them no chance to earn a living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you expected to be arrested?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I had read something
of criminal proceedings, and I knew that the police would
arrest everybody connected with that meeting in order to find
the one who was responsible. I made an explanation before the
Coroner&rsquo;s jury because I had a different idea of the police at
that time. I thought if I made that statement and they inquired
into the truth and were convinced of my innocence they
would let me go. But I now see that I was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the police indict you?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who indicted
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Redirect&mdash;&ldquo;You have heard what has been said about your
expression of throttling the law, of killing it, of stabbing it.
Just state the explanation which you said you desired to make
in regard to that.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, it was just the explanation that a
public orator would make when he was denouncing a political
party. When he said he wanted to get rid of the Democratic
party, for instance, he would kill it, stab it, or make way with it.
The words would rush away with a public speaker, and in the
hurry he could not add a lengthy explanation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You also read the reporter&rsquo;s notes in regard to snails and
worms and said there was no connection there. What were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">Pg&nbsp;83</a></span>

your words in reference to snails and worms, and the idea that
you now remember?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, the idea that I intended to convey
at that time was that when men were thrown out of work
through no fault of their own, and it being a fact that has been
proven and asserted on the floor of the House of Representatives
that over a million of men are out of employment through no
fault of their own&mdash;these men being driven about, become degraded
and loathsome, and people look upon them with contempt,
and yet it is no fault of their own; they have no part in
producing the condition of things that throws them out of employment,
and leads them to their abject condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did not know of the presence of a dynamite bomb or
anything of that kind in the crowd?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir; I did not even
know of the presence of an unusual number of police at the station.
I did not know that till after the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry Schultz, an elderly German, testified that &ldquo;from 9 o&rsquo;clock
until the fight was over I was on the Haymarket; I stood in the middle
of the <del>steet</del><ins>street</ins>, a little north of the
wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long had you been in Chicago at that time?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Two
weeks. I am a tourist.&rdquo; [Laughter.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you been in the habit of attending meetings in the
street?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No; but since I have been here seeing the sights I
would stop at anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before the police came, did you see anything disorderly?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It
was, as I know, peaceable, like a Fourth of July.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the speech of the first speaker?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
know the run of his talk; I kept it in my mind. He said, &lsquo;I
didn&rsquo;t want to come here. Then they called me a coward, and
I didn&rsquo;t like to be called a coward, and that is the reason I
came.&rsquo; A few words after that he said: &lsquo;They are only 500

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">Pg&nbsp;84</a></span>

yards from here. Maybe by to-morrow morning I will have to
die.&rsquo; I kept that on my mind. I left the meeting when the
black cloud came up, and when the bomb exploded I looked
around the corner, and I saw everything dark, and I thought
the bomb must have blown out the lights.&rdquo; [Laughter.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;What else did you <del>seee</del><ins>see</ins>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I saw
the policemen and they were all around. They had the ground. I saw
some of the workmen run&mdash;they were about two blocks ahead of the
police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the police come upon the working men?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
came pretty strong in Lake street, and they had the men
in the gutter, and when they raised up they got another club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell&mdash;&ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Doing nothing,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Schultz, with a grin at the crowd, and the crowd
laughed in a guarded way, because they did not wish to be fired
out of the entertainment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long have you been conducting that business?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About
ten years. Before that I was mining in Montana.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your house in Portage City?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next house
to the courthouse,&rdquo; responded the witness with a cunning look
at the Court, and there was another wild outburst of mirth from
the audience. Mr. Schultz narrated a part of his early history,
from which it appeared that before he became a millionaire he
played the fiddle at dances; and in answer to a question as to
when he began to be a musician, he said: &ldquo;From nine years
old. My father was a musician&mdash;it runs in the family.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you play the violin since you have been in Chicago?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No;
my money reaches so that I don&rsquo;t have to do anything.&rdquo;
[Laughter.]</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first speaker was Spies, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t
promise anything,&rdquo; said Mr. Schultz, with a contortion of countenance

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">Pg&nbsp;85</a></span>

which brought down the house. Judge Gary looked
indignantly around and said: &ldquo;Oh! be quiet!&rdquo; and the crowd
immediately became as demure as a Quaker meeting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Spies say about the police being so many feet
away?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He said they was only five hundred yards from here
and he was likely to die before morning. That was about all
he said in that run of speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the first speaker say anything about &lsquo;To arms!
to arms!&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;That was the man&mdash;I heard him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you go when you left the meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I went
to wash my feet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The expression on Mr. Schultz&rsquo;s face, and the simplicity
of the answer, upset the decorum of the spectators and they
laughed right out in meetin&rsquo;, regardless of the threatened
<del>penality</del><ins>penalty</ins> for such a glaring contempt of
court. Judge Gary himself, however, assisted in the hilarity, and was
very lenient with the offenders, a fellow-feeling evidently making him
wondrous kind. Mr. Schultz a moment afterward had an opportunity to
correct the impression that he was in the habit of touring around the
streets of Chicago in his bare feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have your boots off when you were washing your
feet?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, no; I didn&rsquo;t wash my feet; I only washed the mud
off my boots in one of them horse-troughs.&rdquo; Then Mr. Schultz
treated the company to a choice selection of facial contortions,
and got down out of the chair with the air of a man who has
done his duty, his whole duty, and nothing but his duty.</p>

<p>MICHAEL SCHWAB.</p>

<p>The defendant, Michael Schwab, was put on the stand Monday,
August 9. He testified that he went to the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">Pg&nbsp;86</a></span>

office on the evening of May 4. A telephone message was
received requesting Spies to speak at a meeting near Deering&rsquo;s
Harvester works, on Clybourn avenue. The witness said he
went to the Haymarket to find Spies, but failed. He did see
Rudolph Schnaubelt, his brother-in-law, there. Witness then
took a street car and went up Clybourn avenue; spoke twenty
minutes at the meeting; stepped into a saloon and got a few
glasses of beer, and then went to his home, on Florimond street,
arriving about 11 o&rsquo;clock P. M.</p>

<p>Mr. Foster asked: &ldquo;Were you ever in the alley at Crane
Bros.&rsquo; that night with Mr. Spies?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you walk west on Randolph street with Mr. Spies two
blocks, then return with him?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Mr. Spies that night?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Mr. Spies hand your brother-in-law a package
that night in the alley at Crane Bros.&rsquo;, and did you say anything
like this: &lsquo;If that won&rsquo;t be enough, shall we get another one?&rsquo;&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No,
sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Mr. Spies at all that night?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you see him at all for the last time that day?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;In
the afternoon. I did not see him again until the next
morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Schwab said he had been a member of the Internationalist
society since its organization. On the night of May 4 he went
to the Haymarket on foot and walked through the Washington
street tunnel. Balthazar Rau accompanied him as far west as
Desplaines street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you an Anarchist?&rdquo; asked Mr. Grinnell.&mdash;&ldquo;It depends
on what you mean. There are several definitions of that.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/z097.jpg" width="400" height="485" alt="Michael Schwab" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Michael Schwab.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">Pg&nbsp;87</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer my question. Are you an Anarchist?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
answer that.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>AUGUST SPIES.</h3>

<p>Schwab stepped down and Spies took the stand. &ldquo;Give your
full name to the jury,&rdquo; said Captain Black.</p>

<p>&ldquo;August Vincent Theodore Spies,&rdquo; replies the prisoner.</p>

<p>He is thirty-one years old, and came to this county from
Germany in 1872. Spies speaks with a marked accent, but very
distinctly. He is cool and collected apparently, and sits back
in the witness chair very much at ease.</p>

<p>He has been a member of the Socialistic Publishing Society,
and that concern exercised control over the policy of the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite>, of which paper the witness was editor for six years.
Spies said he was at a meeting on the &ldquo;black road&rdquo; on May 3.
Spies reached the meeting on the &ldquo;black road&rdquo; about 3 o&rsquo;clock
in the afternoon. There was a crowd of perhaps three thousand
present. Some men were speaking, but they were very poor
speakers, and the crowd was not interested. Balthazar Rau was
with him, and introduced him to the chairman of the meeting.
It was called for the purpose of discussing the eight-hour question.
While Spies was there a committee was appointed to wait
on the bosses; then he was introduced, and spoke for possibly
twenty minutes. Spies went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was almost prostrated. I had been speaking two or three
times daily for the past two or three weeks, and was very much
worn. I did not jump around and wave my hands as one witness
testified here on the stand, and I made a very common-place,
ordinary speech. I told the men to hold together, to
stand by their union, or they would not succeed. That was the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">Pg&nbsp;88</a></span>

substance of what I said. While I was speaking some one cried
out in an unknown tongue, and about two hundred men detached
themselves from the crowd and went on to McCormick&rsquo;s.
Pretty soon I heard firing, and on inquiring what was the matter
was told the men had attacked McCormick&rsquo;s men, and that
the police were firing on them. I stopped for about five minutes,
was elected a member of the committee; then I went to
McCormick&rsquo;s. A lot of cars were standing on the tracks. The
men were hiding behind these cars, others were running, while
the police were firing on the flying people. The sight of this
made my blood boil. At that time I could have done almost
anything, I was so excited. A young Irishman came out from
behind one of the cars. I think he knew me and said: &lsquo;What
kind of &mdash;&mdash; business is this? There are two men over there
dead; the police have killed them.&rsquo; I asked him how many
were killed. He said five or six, and that twenty-five or thirty
were injured. I came down town then and wrote the report
which appeared in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> the next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you write the &lsquo;Revenge Circular&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; only I did
not write the word &lsquo;Revenge.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell how that word happened to<ins> be</ins> put in the
circular?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of those circulars were distributed?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About
twenty-five hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How soon was it written after your return to the
office?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Immediately.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time were you still laboring under the excitement
incident to the riot?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was your state of mind?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was very indignant.
I knew from experience of the past that this butchering of people
was done for the express purpose of defeating the eight-hour
movement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spies is growing excited. Mr. Grinnell objects.
The Court says his last answer is not proper and orders it
stricken from the record.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the evening of May 4 you attended the Haymarket
meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were asked to speak there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did <ins>you</ins> learn there was to be a
meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About 8 o&rsquo;clock that morning. I was advised there was
to be a meeting and was asked to address it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What time did you reach there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About 8:20 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see the notice of that meeting in the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; I put it in myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see a circular that day, calling for a meeting at
the Haymarket?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. It was the circular containing the
line: &lsquo;Working men, arm yourselves and appear in full force.&rsquo;
When I read that line I said: &lsquo;If this is the meeting I am to
address I will not speak.&rsquo; He asked why. I said on account
of that line. He said the circulars had not been distributed, and
I said: &lsquo;If the line is taken out I will go.&rsquo; Fischer was sent
for and he told the men to have that line taken out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who was this man that brought the circulars?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He was
on the stand; Gruenberg is his name, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was there any torch on the wagon?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No; I think the
sky was clear and that the lamp was burning near the corner of
the alley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was that selection made by yourself, or upon consultation?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,
I consulted with my brother Henry. He was
with me all evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;After you got them together, what did you do?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">Pg&nbsp;90</a></span>

one suggested we had better move the wagon around on Randolph
street, but I said that might impede the street cars. Then
I asked where was Parsons. I was not on the committee of arrangements
and had nothing to do with the meeting except to
speak. One Schroder said Parsons was speaking then at the
corner of Halsted and Randolph streets, and I went up to find
him with my brother Henry and Schnaubelt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Schwab?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, I did not. Schnaubelt told
me Schwab had gone to Deering&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you go to Crane&rsquo;s alley with Schwab?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I could not
very well do that, as I had not seen him that night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just answer the question,&rdquo; cried Mr. Ingham.&mdash;&ldquo;Well, I
did not go to the alley. I did not even know there was an alley
there.&rdquo; The witness denies the conversation Mr. Thompson
alleges he overheard Spies engage in with Schwab. He said
Schnaubelt cannot speak any English&mdash;that he has only been
about two years in the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Schwab say to you that evening: &lsquo;Now, if they come,
we are prepared for them&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir; I did not see him that
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you talk with Schwab on the east side of Desplaines
street, about twelve feet south of the alley that evening?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
did not. I was not anywhere near that alley with any man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember what the witness Thompson said, that he
saw you walk with Schnaubelt east on Randolph street; that he
saw you hand him something; that you then returned to the
meeting together. Is that true?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is not. That man told
a different story before the coroner&rsquo;s jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This last answer is ordered stricken out, and Spies was told
to say nothing but in answer to questions. Spies was asked to

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">Pg&nbsp;91</a></span>

tell what he said at the meeting. It was a short synopsis of the
existing state of the labor world. First, he said that the meeting
was to be a peaceable one; that it was not called for the
purpose of creating trouble. Attention was directed to the
strike at East St. Louis, where those who were active in the riots
there were not Socialists nor Anarchists, but church-going people,
and honest, sincere Christians. It was admitted by students
that society was retrograding; the masses were being degraded
under the excessive work they had to carry on. For twenty
years the working men asked in vain for two hours less work a
day, and that finally they resolved to take the matter in their
own hands and help themselves. &ldquo;About this time I saw Parsons,
then I broke off. I was not in a state to make a speech. I
was tired. I introduced Parsons, and he proceeded to address
the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the size of the crowd then?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;About two
thousand persons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you go after finishing your speech?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I remained
on the wagon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke in English?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I made no speech in
German that night. I was asked to do so, but was too tired. I
introduced Fielden and he made a brief speech, then we intended
to go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Parsons say in his speech?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Parsons made a
pretty good speech. He said of the dollar earned by the working
men they got only fifteen cents, while the pharisaical class
got eighty-five cents, and that the eight-hour movement was a
still-hunt for that eighty-five cents.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you remember of Fielden&rsquo;s speech?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">Pg&nbsp;92</a></span>

Fielden did not say much. I don&rsquo;t remember now what he did
say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you on the wagon when the police came?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.
I saw the police on Randolph street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time what was the size of the meeting?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It was
as good as adjourned. About two-thirds of those present went,
some going to Zephf&rsquo;s hall when the black cloud came up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you hear when the command to disperse was given?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
was standing in the middle of the wagon, back of Fielden. I heard
Captain Ward say; &lsquo;I command you, in the name of the people of
Illinois, to disperse.&rsquo; Captain Ward had a cane or club in his hand.
<del>Fidlden</del><ins>Fielden</ins> said to him: &lsquo;Captain, this is a
peaceable meeting.&rsquo; I started to get down out of the wagon. My brother
Henry and one Legner helped me down. I was indignant at the thought
that the police had come to disperse the meeting, as it was a quiet
one. Just as soon as I reached the ground I heard a loud detonation.
I thought the police had a cannon to frighten the people. I did not
dream for a moment of a bomb, and I did not even then think the police
were firing at the crowd. I thought the police were firing over their
heads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did you go to?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I was pushed along by the
crowd. I went to Zephf&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you at any time that night get down from the wagon
and go into an alley and light a bomb in the hands of Rudolph
Schnaubelt?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I never did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see Schnaubelt in the alley that night while
Fischer was there?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember the witness Gilmer?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is his story true?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Not a word of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">Pg&nbsp;93</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You remember Wilkinson, the reporter for the <cite>Daily
News</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I had a conversation with him in January.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, go on and tell us about it.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He was introduced to
me by Joe Gruenhut. He said he wanted to get some data wherewith to
prepare an article on Anarchism, Socialism and dynamite, and all that.
I happened to have four shells in my office. I had them for about three
years. A man on his way to New Zealand gave me two bombs; another man
some time after called at my office with two bombs, and wanted to know
if their construction was proper. That&rsquo;s how I came to possess them. He
wanted one to show to Mr. Stone. I let him take it. We went to dinner
at a <del>restaurent</del><ins>restaurant</ins>, and we conversed about
society, its present state, and the trouble that was likely to ensue.
We spoke about street warfare, as all this was contained in the papers
every day. There was constant talk that so many wild-eyed Socialists
were arriving every day, and I told him it was an open secret that
there were 3,000 armed Socialists in Chicago, and we spoke about
revolutions, and I said that in past ages gun-powder had come to the
assistance of the down-trodden masses, and that dynamite was a child of
the same parent, and was a great leveler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the toothpick illustration?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I
remember that, and also re-call speaking of the Washington
street tunnel, saying how easy comparatively few men could
hold that tunnel against a body of soldiers, but nothing was
said about Chicago, nor was any time fixed for the revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wrote the word &lsquo;Ruhe&rsquo; for insertion in the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite> May 4?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you come to do that?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The night before at 11
o&rsquo;clock I received a letter as follows: <em>Mr. Editor</em>: Please insert

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">Pg&nbsp;94</a></span>

in to-day&rsquo;s letter-box the word &lsquo;Ruhe&rsquo; in prominent letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At that time did you know there was any import attached
to the word?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you next hear of it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The next afternoon
Balthazar Rau asked me if the word was in the paper. I said:
&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; He asked me if I knew the meaning. I said: &lsquo;No.&rsquo;
Then he said: &lsquo;The armed section had a meeting last night
and adopted the word &lsquo;Ruhe&rsquo; as a signal to keep their powder
dry and be in readiness in case the police precipitated a riot.&rsquo;
I asked if that had anything to do with the meeting I was to
address at the Haymarket, and he said: &lsquo;Oh, no; that&rsquo;s something
the boys got up themselves.&rsquo; I said it was very foolish,
that it was not rational, and asked if there was no way in which
it could be undone. Rau then went to see the people of the
armed section and told them the word was put in by mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you a member of the armed section?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, not for
six year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever have dynamite and a fuse in your desk?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,
I had two packages of giant powder and some fuse in my
desk for two years. I had them chiefly to show to reporters,
they bothered me a good deal. They always wanted some sensation.
Then, too, I wanted the dynamite to study it; I had
read a great deal about explosives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about a package of dynamite
found on the shelf in the closet of the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Ab-so-lute-ly nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about a revolver that was found in the
<cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No. I do not. I carried a
revolver myself, but it was a good one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you carry a revolver?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes. I always thought it

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">Pg&nbsp;95</a></span>

was a good thing to be prepared. I was out late at night a
good deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you have a revolver that night?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, it was too
heavy. I left it with ex-Ald. Frank Stauber.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were arrested May 5?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us how.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, an officer&mdash;James Bonfield, I
think&mdash;came to my office and asked for Schwab. He said Chief
Ebersold would like to see him. Schwab asked me if he should go. I
said yes, he might. Then the officer turned to me and asked me if my
name was Spies. I said yes. Then he said Superintendent Ebersold would
like to see me about that affair of last night. I went over there,
unsuspectingly. I was never so treated before in all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell what happened?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Well, as soon as I got into the
station Superintendent Ebersold started at me. He said: &lsquo;You
dirty Dutch dog; you hound; you whelp&mdash;you, we will strangle
you! We will kill you!&rsquo; Then they jumped on us, tore us
apart from each other. I never said anything. Then they
searched us, took our money, even our handkerchiefs, and would
not return them to us. I was put in a cell, and have not had
my liberty since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ingham cross-examined the witness. Spies said he came to this
country when seventeen years old, and that he has lived in Chicago some
thirteen years. The <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> was controlled by
what Spies termed an &ldquo;autonomous editorial arrangement;&rdquo; that is, the
powers of the several editors were co-ordinate, but the general policy
of the paper was under the supervision of the board of trustees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever receive any money for the <cite>Alarm</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever pay out any money for the <cite>Alarm</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">Pg&nbsp;96</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you ever write any articles for the <cite>Alarm</cite>?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I may
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many bombs did you have in the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>
office?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Four, I think. Two I got from a man named Schwab. I
forget now. He was a shoemaker. He went to New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did this man come to give you those bombs?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He
came to me and asked me if my name was Spies. I said yes.
Then he asked me if I had seen any of the bombs they were
making. I said no. Then he left them with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did he mean by &rsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he say who they were?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you never saw him before or
since?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when did you get these czar bombs?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I never got
them. That is an invention of that reporter. A man came
there while I was at dinner and left them there. He left the
bombs with the bookkeeper. I never saw him before or after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ingham introduced a letter and a postal card found in
Spies&rsquo; desk, the reading of which, as translated by Mr. Gauss,
created a great sensation. Spies acknowledged the writing as
addressed to him by Johann Most, the noted Anarchist:</p>

<blockquote>

   <p>&ldquo;DEAR SPIES:&mdash;Are you sure that the letter from the
   Hocking Valley was not written by a detective? In the week I
   will go to Pittsburgh, I have an inclination also to go to
   the Hocking Valley. For the present I send you some printed
   matter. There Sch. and H. also existed but on paper. I told
   you this some months ago. On the other hand, I am able to
   furnish &ldquo;<em>medicine</em>&rdquo;, and the &ldquo;<em>genuine</em>&rdquo;
   article at that. Directions for use are perhaps not needed
   with these people. Moreover, they were recently published in
   the &ldquo;Fr.&rdquo; The appliances I can

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">Pg&nbsp;97</a></span>

   also send. Now, if you consider the address of Buchtell
   thoroughly reliable, I will ship twenty or twenty-five pounds.
   But how? Is there an express line to the place? Or is there
   another way possible? Polus the great seems to delight in
   <del>hoping</del><ins>hopping</ins> about in the swamps of the
   N. Y. V. Z., like a blown-up (bloated) frog. His tirades excite
   general detestation. He has made himself immensely ridiculous.
   The main thing is only that the fellow cannot smuggle any more
   <del>rotton</del><ins>rotten</ins> elements into the newspaper
   company than are already in it. In this regard the caution is
   important. The organization here is no better nor worse than
   formerly. Our group has about the strength of the North side
   group in Chicago, and then, besides this, we have also the soc.
   rev. 6, the Austrian and Bohemian leagues&mdash;three more
   groups. Finally, it is easily seen that our influence with
   the trade organizations is steadily growing. We insert our
   meetings only in the Fr., and cannot notice that they are worse
   attended than at the time when we yet threw the weekly $1.50
   and $2 into the mouth of the N. Y. V. Z. Don&rsquo;t forget
   putting yourself into communication with Drury in reference
   to the English organ. He will surely work with you much and
   well. Such a paper is more necessary than the <em>Tooth</em>.
   This, indeed, is getting more miserable and confused from
   issue to issue, and in general is whistling from the last
   hole. Inclosed is a fly-leaf
   which recently appeared at Emden, and is, perhaps, adopted for
   reprint. Greetings to Schwab, Rau, and to you. Your</p>

   <p>&ldquo;JOHANN MOST.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;To Buchtell I will, of course, write for the
   present only in general terms.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;A. Spies, 107 Fifth avenue, Chicago, Ill.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">Pg&nbsp;98</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gauss then read the following as his translation of the
postal card:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;DEAR SPIES:&mdash;I had scarcely mailed my letter
   yesterday when the telegraph brought news from H. M. One does
   not know whether to rejoice over that or not. The advance in
   itself is elevating. Sad is the circumstance that it will
   remain local and therefore may not have the result. At any
   rate, these people made a better impression than the foolish
   voters on this and the other side of the ocean. Greeting and a
   hail. Your</p>

   <p> &ldquo;J. M.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>W. A. S. Graham, a reporter for <cite>The Times</cite>, testified that
he talked with the witness for the prosecution, Harry Gilmer,
on the afternoon of May 5, and that Gilmer said the man who
threw the bomb lit the fuse himself. &ldquo;He said he saw the man
light the fuse and throw the bomb, and that he could identify
him again if he saw him. He said the man was of medium size
and had a soft hat and whiskers. He said the man&rsquo;s back was
turned to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this stage the defense rested, and evidence in rebuttal
was introduced. Justice Daniel Scully testified that in the preliminary
examination of one Frank Steuner, charged with shooting
from the wagon at the Haymarket, Officers Foley and
Wessler did not testify that it was Steuner who fired on the
police.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the officers not say the man who jumped up from behind
the wagon was a heavy man, with long whiskers (Fielden)?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;They
did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did not Officer Foley say he would be able to identify this
man if he ever saw him again?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;He did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John B. Ryan, an attorney who defended Steuner before

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">Pg&nbsp;99</a></span>

Justice Scully, testified that Steuner said at the time that the
man who did the shooting was a short, heavy-set man with full
whiskers.</p>

<p>United States District Attorney R. S. Tuthill, Charles B.
Dibble, an attorney, Judge Chester C. Cole, of Des Moines,
Iowa, E. R. Mason, Clerk of the United States District Court
at Des Moines, George Crist, Ex-City Marshal of Des Moines,
and Ex-Governor Samuel Merrill of Iowa, all testified to the
good character of the witness Gilmer. They would believe him
under oath. Governor Merrill had known Gilmer since 1872,
and had given him employment.</p>

<p>As the great trial drew toward its close popular interest in
the proceedings increased. The Criminal Court building was
crowded with people daily long before the hour for opening
court arrived, and many times the number who gained admission
were turned away. On the day of the closing argument by
the prosecution, and while the jury were deliberating over their
verdict, extra precautions were taken to protect the administrators
of the law. A cordon of police and deputy sheriffs surrounded
the building, and no one was allowed to enter who
could not be properly identified.</p>

   <h2 class="nobreak"><a id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>
</div>

<p class="chapsum">Arguments for the prosecution and defense.</p>

<p>Assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney Frank Walker began the opening
argument for the prosecution Wednesday, August 11. The
speaker said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We stand in the temple of justice to exercise the law,
where all men stand equal. No matter what may have been
the deep turpitude of the crime, no matter what may have been
the design, though it aim even at the overthrow of the law itself,
no man ought to be convicted of the crime charged until proven
guilty beyond all reasonable doubt. These men were presumed
innocent at the outset until the proof presented by the State established
their guilt. The defendants were charged with murder.
Murder was defined to be the unlawful killing of a person
in the peace of the people. An accessory was he who stands
by and aids or abets or advises the deed, or who, not standing
by, aids or abets or advises the deed, and such persons are to be
considered as principals and punished. Whether the principals
are punished or not, they are equally as guilty as the principals.
When a number of persons conspire together to do a certain
act, and when, in furtherance of this design, some one is killed,
all those in the conspiracy are guilty of murder before the fact.
The defendant&rsquo;s counsel have told you these men conspired to
precipitate the social revolution, and though that conspiracy
cost Matthias J. Degan his life, yet you are told these defendants
are guilty only of murder. Was Luther Payne or Mrs.
Surratt held guilty when in the execution of a conspiracy President
Lincoln was killed? Neither Payne nor Surratt committed
the deed, yet they were held guilty. There was a
conspiracy; it was designed to bring about another revolution.
Booth killed President Lincoln, but all who participated in the
conspiracy had to forfeit their lives.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/z115.jpg" width="399" height="321"
        alt="Counsel for the State." />
   <div class="caption"><p>Counsel for the State.</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">Pg&nbsp;101</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If a body of men, inflamed with resentment, proceed to pull
down a building, or to remove an objectionable obstruction and
death to some one ensues, each one of these men is individually
responsible for the killing. Nobody knew this better than August
Spies, the author of the &lsquo;Revenge&rsquo; circular. Suppose that a body of
men undertake to pull down a building; there is a common design to
demolish that building, and a stone is thrown, not at any individual
but at the building, and some one is struck by this stone and killed,
all of those engaged in the execution of that common design are
<del>responsable</del><ins>responsible</ins> for the killing of this
one person. When there is an intent grievously to hurt and death is
occasioned, then the offense is murder. Was this man [pointing to
Fischer] in this conspiracy for murder? This man with his revolver a
foot long and his file dagger with a groove? What is this groove for?
It is for prussic acid. Was this man in the conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Walker then read a passage from Most&rsquo;s &ldquo;Revolutionary
Warfare&rdquo; telling how prussic acid can be applied to
grooved daggers, making them the more deadly. &ldquo;This is the
test: Was the bomb thrown in furtherance of the common
design? If it was it makes no difference whether it was thrown
by one of these conspirators here or not. Nobody had been
advocating the use of dynamite but Socialists. Was there anybody
who would throw a bomb except a Socialist? We have
proved that Lingg made the bomb in furtherance of the common
design. &lsquo;You have done this, Louis Lingg,&rsquo; said Huebner,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">Pg&nbsp;102</a></span>

and Lingg went away and complained that he was blamed for
doing the good work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Walker reiterated that every one of the 3,000 men said
by Spies to have participated in the conspiracy were equally
guilty of the murder of Officer Degan. All the members of
the Lehr und Wehr Verein were included in this charge. He
pointed out the fact that nearly all of the witnesses for the defense
are members of Anarchist bodies; that their sympathies
are with the prisoners, and that it has been abundantly shown
by their cross-examination that they would not hesitate to
pervert the truth in order to shield their confederates from
the consequences of their acts.</p>

<h3>MR. ZEISLER FOR THE DEFENSE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Zeisler, of the counsel for the defense, set to work at
once to tear Mr. Walker&rsquo;s address to pieces. He accused the
assistant State&rsquo;s Attorney of distorting the facts in the case,
and attempting to bring about a conviction by working on the
prejudices and suspicions of the jury. Mr. Walker impugned
the motives and the characters of the defenses&rsquo; witnesses.
Mr. Zeisler continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are their principal witnesses? The policemen who
were at the Haymarket. And before we get through we will
show that these men were not heroes, but knaves, led on by
the most cowardly knave who ever held a public position. It
has been proved that most of these policemen who went on
the stand had been at one time or another members of the
detective force, and the Supreme Court tells us that a detective
is a liar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker went on to attack the other State witnesses.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">Pg&nbsp;103</a></span>

Detectives are taken from the criminal classes. Harry L. Gilmer,
he said, is <ins>a </ins>constitutional liar, and the only witness who has
been impeached. Some of the reporters, he acknowledges, tell
the truth, and on their statements the defense will partially rely
to show the innocence of the prisoners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody understands why the police came down to break
up the meeting. Detectives have sworn here that after Mr.
Parsons suggested that the meeting adjourn to Zephf&rsquo;s hall, and
the sky clouded up, the crowd dwindled down to two hundred
or three hundred men, and then came this army of 180 policemen,
armed with clubs and revolvers, headed by this hero, Bonfield,
the savior of his country, to break up this meeting of
peaceable and unarmed citizens. Was this courageous, or was
it cowardly? It was an assault in the eyes of the law. The
counsel for the State have attempted to make you believe that
these disciples of Herr Most took a match and lighted a bomb
which Most says should have a fuse not longer than two inches.
Doesn&rsquo;t it seem very probable that they would have lighted with
a match this fuse, which would burn out in a few seconds, when
they could have carried a lighted cigar to do it with? We
have the testimony of a number of witnesses that Spies was not
out of the wagon till the trouble began; and if Mr. Grinnell had
had more sense in the prosecution of this case; if he had not
been blinded by malice and prejudice; if he had not been influenced
by the police conspiracy to send these men to the gallows,
he would have seen the uselessness of attempting to secure
a conviction by such testimony as that of Gilmer.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>MR. INGHAM FOR THE PROSECUTION.</h3>

<p>Mr. George Ingham addressed the jury for the prosecution.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">Pg&nbsp;104</a></span>

He told them that there are verdicts which make history, and
that theirs will be a history-making verdict. On the night of
May 4, at 10 o&rsquo;clock, Matthias J. Degan marched out of the
Desplaines street station, full of life, and was soon afterward
struck down by the hands of these defendants, not one of whom
he had ever injured. The speaker told the jury again what
&ldquo;reasonable doubt&rdquo; means. He said that the grand jury might
have indicted 300 men instead of eight, but they saw fit to pick
out the eight whom they deemed the leaders of the conspiracy
against law and human life. There had been a good deal of
talk, he said, about the constitutional right of free speech. The
Constitution gave the people the right to meet and petition, but
not to advise other people to commit murder. This right was
based upon the old English common law, and in England was
also found a definition of what constitutes incitement to murder.
The case he was going to quote had also had another connection
with the present one. It was brought in London in 1881 against
Johann Most, who was then publishing his sheet, the <cite>Freiheit</cite>,
in that city. It was shortly after the assassination of the Czar
of Russia. He there advocated the assassination of all the heads
of States, from Constantinople to Washington, and was convicted
of inciting to murder. Mr. Ingham read the proceedings in
the English court, the article upon which he was tried, and
Lord Coleridge&rsquo;s decision. Then he said: &ldquo;It is shown that
these defendants&mdash;Spies, Parsons, Schwab and Fischer&mdash;were
engaged in the publication of articles in which they advised the
destruction of the police by force, in which they advised working
men to arm themselves with dynamite and be ready whenever
the conflict should come to destroy the police force. For
the publication of any one of these articles the defendants could

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">Pg&nbsp;105</a></span>

have been convicted of a misdemeanor. And when Fielden
that night told the people that war had been declared and that
they must arm themselves to resist what had never taken place,
he was guilty of a misdemeanor, and for that reason, if for no
other, the police had a right to disperse the meeting. The treatment
that Herr Most received in London shows you that the
only salvation of a community is to enforce the letter of the law
without sentiment, that bloodshed may be avoided. Herr Most
was convicted for the publication of that article, and no English
policemen have been blown up with dynamite. He came to
this country, and the policemen who have been blown up are
the American officers right here in this city. If we have not
enforced the law it is high time that we enforce it now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ingham then showed that the Haymarket meeting was
a trap for the police designed for the purpose of leading them
into a dark, dangerous place, the speeches being the bait, artfully
increased until the police came to the alley and the bomb
could be thrown. &ldquo;Now who made the bomb? It is in evidence
that Louis Lingg had been making bombs of a certain
construction which Spies had said were superior, being of composite
metal. It is in evidence that Lingg all the morning of
May 4 was away from his house; that he upbraided Seliger for
having made but one bomb. During the afternoon he was busy
making bombs, and men came and went and worked at the
bombs in his house. There is a story of a man who that day
received bombs and dynamite from Lingg, showing that he distributed
them.&rdquo; Mr. Ingham read to the jury the chemical
analysis of the bombs furnished by Drs. Haines and Delafontaine.
What is the answer to all this? That the bomb was
not thrown from the alley, but from thirty-eight feet south of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">Pg&nbsp;106</a></span>

the alley. And if they had satisfied you of that, was it not
still thrown by one of the Anarchists&mdash;one of the conspirators?
The bomb came from the conspiracy. And the moment it resulted
in the death of Degan the crime of conspiracy was
merged into the crime of murder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When Sumter was fired on, when the flag was insulted, when the
attempt was made to destroy the Government, it was an attempt merely
to change the form of government. When the bomb in this war was thrown
it was the opening shot of a war which should destroy all government,
destroy all law, leave men free to live as they see fit, and leave
nothing to guide but the strong arm. I believe for myself that
humanity&mdash;not merely our people, not merely we of America, but
that humanity the wide world over&mdash;has no hope or no safety save
the law. Law is the very shield that guards the progression of the
race; it is the palladium of the liberty and lives of all people. Law
which does not punish murder breeds death. Jurors who from the merciful
instincts of their hearts hesitate to convict the guilty, are, in
reality, <del>mercilesss</del><ins>merciless</ins> as the grave, for by
their verdict they people graves with the innocent victims of midnight
assassination and fill the mind with deeds of blood. Innocent blood
from the days of Abel till now cries to Heaven for vengeance; innocent
blood that contaminates the ground upon which it falls, and from it
spring up dragon&rsquo;s teeth. And now if you believe these men guilty, if
you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, as you cannot help but be,
that these men were a party to a conspiracy unlawful in its nature,
and that from that conspiracy a human life was taken, that they are
murderers under that law, see to it that the majesty of the law of the
state of Illinois is vindicated, and its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">Pg&nbsp;107</a></span>

penalties enforced. That is the demand upon you this day and
this hour, not only of the people of the state of Illinois, but of
humanity itself; for humanity, with all its fears, with all its
hopes for future years, is hanging breathless on your fate.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>MR. FOSTER FOR THE DEFENSE.</h3>

<p>Mr. Foster, who followed for the defense, had not lived
long in Chicago. He came in March from Davenport, Iowa,
near which city he was born about forty years ago. He is of
medium height and square build. His features are refined
and intellectual. An abundant growth of rich auburn hair
adorns his shapely head. Mr. Foster obtained considerable
fame as a lawyer in his native state, took an active part in politics,
and was one of the Blaine Electors in 1884, and was very
active in the campaign of that year. After having made an
energetic and finely-eloquent plea to the jury to cast aside all
prejudice arising from hatred of the principles of the Anarchists,
love of and loyalty to the land, inherent patriotism, and
the teachings of the popular press, Mr. Foster proceeded,
in order to set himself right, to tear down without apology the
theory of the defense set up by Messrs. Salomon &amp; Zeisler. He
had no defense to make for Socialism&mdash;it is dangerous; Communism
is pernicious, and Anarchism is damnable. Lingg had
manufactured bombs, and he ought to be punished therefor; but
he was on trial for throwing, not manufacturing bombs. Spies,
Schwab and Fischer had no business to preach social revolution
in America. If they were not satisfied with the state of things
here they ought to have gone back to Germany and tried to reform
things there. Mr. Fielden might have found occupation
in teaching his brother Englishmen to be just to Ireland. Parsons

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">Pg&nbsp;108</a></span>

he rebuked in an eloquent passage for his lack of patriotism.
Having thus skillfully set himself right with the jurors,
Mr. Foster proceeded to define the issue of the trial as he understood
it, and as he wished the jury to understand it. He
admitted the moral responsibility of some of the prisoners for
the crime. He denied their legal responsibility.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our law knows no citizenship when a defendant is brought
to the bar of justice. Our law is grand enough, our law is
broad enough, the principles upon which our Government is
founded are such that it matters not whether he be French, German,
Irish, Italian, or wherever his birthplace may be. All
men are equal before the law. They are all citizens of the
United States except Louis Lingg. I believe the testimony
shows that he has been in the country two years. I think that
Spies said he came here in infancy. I know as a matter of fact
that Neebe, born in the state of Pennsylvania, never was a foreigner.
Schwab has been in this country long enough to be a
citizen. Whether he is or not is entirely immaterial for the
purposes of this case. I know that Fielden has been here more
than twenty years. I know that Fischer has been in Chicago
for the last ten to twelve years, and Engel for fifteen or twenty
years. What is the importance of the suggestion that they are
foreigners, and Germans, except that it is important to wring
from you a verdict grounded on prejudice. * * * It was
an open secret that the defendants were indicted for murder,
conspiracy and riot, but I will only argue the question of conspiracy
so far as it relates to the crime of murder. The question
of Socialism was of no importance unless it was connected with
the murder of Degan, and the defendants were not being tried
for any offense but that of conspiracy which resulted in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">Pg&nbsp;109</a></span>

murder of Degan. The prosecution had been trying to tote the defendants
out into the underbrush and assassinate them on immaterial issues; but
the defendants&rsquo; counsel were too smart to be seduced by the song of
the siren. Suppose Spies <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et. al.</span> did conspire
to overthrow society and their conspiracy stopped there, then there
was nothing to argue. A verdict rendered upon anything else than a
conspiracy directly connected with the outrage perpetrated at the
Haymarket, would fall to the ground and amount to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Referring to the popular clamor against the Socialists, Mr.
Foster said: &ldquo;Outside of you twelve gentlemen, the judge upon
the bench, and counsel on either side, there is not a man in Chicago
who has a right to say he has an opinion founded upon the
facts in this case. If these men are to be tried on general principles
for advocating doctrines opposed to our ideas of propriety,
there is no use for me to argue the case. Let the Sheriff go and
erect the scaffold; let him bring eight ropes with dangling nooses
at the ends; let him pass them around the necks of these eight
men; and let us stop this farce now, if the verdict and conviction
is to be upon prejudice and general principles. We boast
of our courts of justice, of our equitable law, but if the time has
come, when men are to be prejudged before the trial and convicted
upon general principles, all that is grand, sacred, noble and
praiseworthy in our temples of justice will be destroyed. Considering
the experience of us all in relation to this Haymarket
tragedy, considering the facts that we know to be true, do you
blame me for saying I am afraid of your passions? I am afraid
of your prejudices.&rdquo; Holding up the Czar bomb, Mr. Foster
exclaimed in a loud voice: &ldquo;Hang Spies, and Neebe, and
Schwab, and Parsons, and Fielden, and Fischer, and Lingg, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">Pg&nbsp;110</a></span>

Engel!&rdquo; Taking up a tin dynamite can he continued: &ldquo;Among
other things, three tin cans were found under a sidewalk in the
city. Strangle them to death, in part because these three cans
were found! When were they in possession of any of the defendants?
Never, so far as the testimony is concerned. When
were they prepared and filled at the house of any of the defendants,
or any of their associates? Never, so far as the testimony
is concerned. And yet they are not only introduced in evidence,
their contents examined and sworn to, but you are expected to
smell them; you are asked to examine them at the risk of a
headache, and they want your noses near to their tops. Why?
Because they were found in the city of Chicago. And that is
part of the testimony upon which the lives of these eight men
are to be destroyed. But it is all in a lifetime; it is all part of
the grand combination; it is all in the great conspiracy, because
counsel tell us it is. Such evidence was never introduced in any
court of justice in the civilized world without objection. It
was said Herr Most described such things in his book on &lsquo;Revolutionary
Warfare.&rsquo; There is not a word of testimony that
any of the defendants ever read that book. But that does not
make any difference. They are Socialists&mdash;hang them. That
does not make any difference. They are Communists&mdash;hang
them; they are Anarchists&mdash;hang them. I always supposed
that the lowest creature that possessed life was entitled to some
consideration. I supposed there was not a thing in existence
so low, so poor or loathsome, but had some rights, and I do not
believe it now, except it be a Socialist, Communist or Anarchist.
That puts them beyond the pale of civilization; it puts
them beyond the protection of the law; it convicts them of
itself.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN W. P. BLACK FOR THE DEFENSE.</h3>

<p>On Tuesday, August 17, the fiftieth day of the trial, Captain W. P.
Black, <del>fhe</del><ins>the</ins> leading counsel for the defense,
made his plea. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;May it please the Court, and Gentlemen of the jury: On
the morning of May 5, 1886, the good people of Chicago were
startled at the event which happened at the Haymarket.
Fear is the mother of cruelty, and perhaps that will account in
some measure for the bitterness with which the State has prosecuted
this case. The serious question which confronts us,
however, is to what extent, you, gentlemen, in your deliberations,
may be influenced by passion or by prejudice. On the
night of May 4 a dynamite bomb was thrown at the Haymarket
in this city and exploded. It caused widespread havoc and loss
of human life. But the moral responsibility for dynamite does
not rest upon the Socialists. This explosive was given to the
world by science. We might well stand appalled at the dread
results this terrible agent is capable of producing. When a
man is charged, or sought to be charged, with a crime, as in this
case, the people must show who threw the bomb&mdash;who did the
deed&mdash;and must show that these defendants were connected
directly with the guilty man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker said that counsel for the State were wrong
when one of them advised the jury that upon them it depended
to maintain the law and government, because these defendants
plotted against the state. They were revolutionists, it was said,
but that was not true. There can be no revolution, though, except
when the heart of the people rise to redress some great
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">Pg&nbsp;112</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the witnesses for the State, the testimony of two of
them, Gilmer and Thompson, who swore to having seen Schnaubelt
throw the bomb, was impeached. Gilmer&rsquo;s story was utterly
improbable in itself; the rational mind rejected it. Is it
credible? Mr. Ingham has said Spies was the brainiest man
among the Anarchists, and the greatest coward. The witness
Gilmer testified that he saw Spies get down from the wagon and
go into the alley with Schnaubelt; saw him strike the light, fire
the bomb, and give it to Schnaubelt, who hurled it among the
police. Is that credible? Remember, Spies, a man of brains,
of more than average brains; would he light the match that fired
that bomb, and the police almost upon him? Is that credible?
It was also said Spies was a great coward. Then, if that were
true, would he run the risk of lighting the bomb? The counter-proof
was abundant. A half a dozen reputable citizens standing
in the mouth of the alley had testified that they did not see
Spies leave the wagon, and that he did not enter the alley before
the bomb exploded. This was negative testimony, it was true,
but considering the narrow space and how unlikely it was that
Spies, whom they all knew, could enter the alley without being
seen by the witnesses, it was conclusive. Again, two or three
witnesses testified that Schnaubelt went home early in the evening,
disappointed because there was no German speaking, and
was not at the Haymarket when the explosion took place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The circumstantial evidence presented by the State, and by
which it was sought to enmesh the defendants, was next considered.
The case of the state was substantially this. The meeting
at the Haymarket May 4 was an incident in the carrying out
of an organized scheme. August Spies was there to precipitate
a conflict with the police. He put Parsons on the stand, who

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">Pg&nbsp;113</a></span>

made a long harangue, but the police did not appear. Then
Fielden was put up to speak. The police came, and the act was
accomplished. But who called this meeting? Not Spies, not
Neebe, not Parsons, not Schwab, nor Engel, nor Lingg, nor
Fischer, as an individual act. It was the result of another meeting,
held the night before at 54 West Lake street, and about
which Spies knew nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Again, the State wished it to be understood that Spies, in
order to get the men ripe for revolt, went out to McCormick&rsquo;s
May 3, and forced himself on a meeting there. Then, having
worked up his auditors to a pitch of excitement and inflamed
them to attack the non-union men, he came down town and
wrote the &lsquo;Revenge&rsquo; circular, calling for the Haymarket meeting.
But did he encourage the men at McCormick&rsquo;s to violence?
The testimony, and it was not controverted, proved that he
counseled peace; that he told the men to stand firm and to trust
to concerted action for the attainment of their ends. The further
circumstance proving that no violence was contemplated
that night consisted in this, that when the black cloud came up
and rain was threatened, an adjournment was proposed. Fielden
had the stand at that time, but he, simple soul, begged a
few minutes&rsquo; delay, saying he had but little more to say, and
then in all simplicity went on to say it. All this was in the
line going to prove that Spies had no connection with the alleged
conspiracy. The circular calling for the Tuesday night
meeting referred to a specific object. Do not the circumstances,&rdquo;
continued Captain Black, &ldquo;prove that August Spies was
not aware of the meeting held May 3? Do they not prove that
he could have no share in the design of that meeting, of which
the one at Haymarket, with its result, was an incident in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">Pg&nbsp;114</a></span>

general conspiracy? As to the Haymarket meeting, was it not
a lawful assemblage? Who first broke the laws? That meeting
was called by a circular. It was called to denounce a grievance.
Perhaps there was no real grievance, but if the projectors
of the meeting thought there was they had the right to
assemble. The Constitution given us by our forefathers who
made the name of revolutionists glorious, gave us that right.
That right was incorporated in the fundamental laws of the
nation. One clause in the Constitution allows the people to assemble
together in a peaceable manner to discuss their grievances,
another provides that the people have the right to
assemble together in a peaceable manner to discuss measures for
their common good, and to instruct their representatives. I am
not here to defend Socialism, nor do I contend that Anarchy
has in it the elements of true reform, but I am here to defend
these men. They are Socialists. That system centuries ago
had the sanction of St. Augustine. John Stuart Mill is one of
a great host of philosophers who have subscribed in fealty to
Socialism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These defendants have the right to discuss the great
wrongs of the working people. They have the right to try
their remedy. They say that private property is robbery. That
may be false. There is not a Catholic organization that is not
founded on the idea of common co-operation. It was Plato&rsquo;s
dream that the means of existence should be the common property
of all. The Anarchist or Socialist was said to believe
that every law of man was a bone of contention, intended for
the benefit of one class only. The fact that these defendants
are Anarchists is not a fact which would justify the jury in
taking their lives. These men are not the lazy fellows pictured
by the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">Pg&nbsp;115</a></span></p>

<h3>STATE&rsquo;S ATTORNEY JULIUS S. GRINNELL FOR THE PROSECUTION.</h3>

<p>State&rsquo;s Attorney Grinnell closed for the State, and he began
his remarks by criticising counsel for the defense for making
heroes of the prisoners. The Anarchists were compared
to the fathers of our country; they were pictured as martyrs,
as men who sacrificed themselves for the welfare of human
kind. If that be so, songs of praise should be sung, and the
Anarchists ought to be garlanded with flowers. Captain Black
had said that society was discriminating against the poor; that
the struggle for existence was daily becoming harder. That
was not true, for civil liberty was never before as widespread
as it is at present. Mr. Grinnell said the case had received his
entire attention since May 5. Government was on trial. Murder
had been committed. It was sought to know who was
responsible. For a few days after the Haymarket riot it was
not thought it was more far-reaching than the results of the
inflammatory speech-making. It was not until after the magnificent
efforts of Captain Schaack that a conspiracy was developed.
Then Schnaubelt was discovered. It was not until after
Spies was arrested that it became apparent that a man was
capable of the hellish act in which he was concerned. A mistake
had been made. It was said the State would show who
the bomb thrower was. This had not been done, owing to the
inability of certain witnesses to make good on the stand the
statements they had before made to the officers. These men
were not Socialists, but Anarchists, and their creed is no government,
no law. Until placed on the stand these men never

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">Pg&nbsp;116</a></span>

hedged on that definition. It was sought to be shown that the
defendants were barking dogs that would not bite. These men
were on trial, law was on trial, Anarchy was on trial for treason.
The penalty of treason is death. A man can commit an
overt act of treason, and not kill anybody. Is it any the less
treason because seven men are killed and sixty wounded?
There is no statute of limitation for threats, when repeated
threats resulted in the commission of the deed. For years past,
on the Lake front and at the different so-called Socialistic halls
in the city, these men had preached the use of dynamite, poison
and daggers as a means of effecting the social revolution. The
thing should have been stopped long ago. But that was foreign
to the case. The men were here now on trial for murder.
Their threats had been carried out. It did not matter whether
any police officers had overstepped their duty; the jury had
nothing at all to do with that. The accused were on trial for
murder.</p>

<p>On the Lake front the Anarchists were wont to assemble under the
red flag, which they described as the emblem of universal liberty. But
there was but one flag of liberty&mdash;that was the Stars and Stripes;
and it would always remain such if the gentlemen of the jury had the
courage to <del>nphold</del><ins>uphold</ins> the law. Threats had
been mouthed, dire vaporings were spread from one group to another to
fill the people with terror, so that the social revolution might the
more easily be accomplished. Mr. Grinnell holds that Spies wrote the
&ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; circular premeditatedly. He reads it to the jury commenting
on various passages contained therein, and makes it plain to the jury
that Spies had an ulterior and sinister purpose in view when he penned
the famous dodger. There were only two officers at McCormick&rsquo;s when

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">Pg&nbsp;117</a></span>

the mob Spies was addressing broke loose and attacked the
non-union men. The police were called, but why? To protect
the McCormick property and the two officers from the fury of
the mob as well as to save the non-union men from being killed.
It was this sight&mdash;the coming of additional police&mdash;that made
the blood of the valorous Spies boil. Knowing that no fatalities
had taken place, or not knowing that any had <del>occured</del><ins>occurred</ins>,
Spies posted down town, and the &ldquo;Revenge&rdquo; circular was
written by him and in the hands of the printer before 5 o&rsquo;clock
that same afternoon. Balthazar Rau&rsquo;s name was mentioned every
day, time and time again by the defense, but he was not called
as a witness. They were afraid to put him on the stand. It
was Rau who invited Spies to address the Haymarket meeting,
and he was present when Spies made his speech. That was a
kind of Marc Antony address, and to be understood one must
read it between the lines. It was artfully calculated to inflame.
It was a significant opening. The working men were told to
come armed. Waller did come armed. The police should have
broken up the meeting in its incipiency. If Bonfield had not
gone down there at the time he did the riot would have been
general. The reason more bombs were not thrown was that
the other fellows in the conspiracy had not time to reach the
scene. The man who threw the bomb obtained it from Lingg
or Spies, and hurled it according to directions received from one
or other of these men. Did Fielden shoot that night? For
years past he has called the police bloodhounds; he said he
would march down Michigan avenue with the red flag or the
black flag, and preached &ldquo;death to the capitalists and the police,
our despoilers.&rdquo; This must be understood above all things;
that the bomb was thrown in furtherance of the common design,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">Pg&nbsp;118</a></span>

no matter who threw it. Gilmer said Spies handed the bomb
to Schnaubelt. Is that improbable? For years he preached
the throwing of bombs. An article over his own signature is
in evidence, and in this he gives directions as to the manner in
which bombs should be ignited and hurled at the enemy. Who
was Schnaubelt? Schwab&rsquo;s brother-in-law. He is the man
who was arrested before the conspiracy was known and let go,
then shaved off his whiskers, and has not been seen since. A
peculiar circumstance, and the most significant of the case, was
that when Spies was arrested he left the traces of his crime in
his office. Bonfield arrested him. Spies said he went over to
the Central station unsuspectingly. Had he known what was
going to have happened he would have destroyed the &ldquo;Ruhe&rdquo;
manuscript. It was the little mistakes that brought the criminal
to justice, and there never was a criminal, big or little, that
did not leave traces of his crime behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell concluded by saying his labor was over; the
jury&rsquo;s was just begun. They had the power to exact the lives
of some of the prisoners, to others they might give a term of
years in the penitentiary, and some again they might acquit.
He would not ask the jury to take the life of Oscar Neebe. He
would not ask the jury to do what he would not do himself.
The proof was not sufficient to convict Neebe, but some of them,
Spies, Fischer, Lingg, Engel, Fielden, Parsons and Schwab,
ought to have the extreme penalty administered to them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; said Mr. Grinnell, &ldquo;I have not a word to say
against these men. But the law demands that they be punished.
They have violated the law, and you, gentlemen of the jury,
stand between the living and the dead. Do your duty. Do
not disagree.</p>

<p>If you think that some of them do not deserve
the death penalty give them a life sentence, but do not disagree.
Gentlemen, this is no pleasant task for me, but it is my duty;
do yours.&rdquo;</p>

   <p class="chapsum">The instructions of the court.</p>
</div>

<p>In his instructions to the jury Judge Gary said: &ldquo;The Court
instructs the jury that whoever is guilty of murder shall suffer
the punishment of death, or imprisonment in the penitentiary
for his natural life, or for a term of not less than fourteen years.
If the accused are found guilty by a jury they shall fix the punishment
by their verdict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court instructs the jury as a matter of law that, in
considering the case, the jury are not to go beyond the evidence
to hunt up doubts, nor must they entertain such doubts as are
merely chimerical or conjectural. A doubt to justify an acquittal
must be reasonable, and must arise from a candid and
impartial investigation of all the evidence in the case, and unless
it is such that, were the same kind of doubt interposed in the
graver transactions of life, it would cause a reasonable and prudent
man to hesitate and pause, it is sufficient to authorize a
verdict of not guilty. If, after considering all the evidence, you
can say you have an abiding conviction of the truth of the
charge, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it does so prove, then your duty to the State requires
you to convict whosoever is found guilty. The case of each of
the defendants should be considered with the same care and
scrutiny as if he alone were on trial. If a conspiracy having
violence and murder as its object is fully proved, then the acts
and declarations of each one of the conspirators, before or after

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">Pg&nbsp;120</a></span>

May 4, which are merely narrative as to what had been or would
be done, and not made to aid in carrying into effect the object
of the conspiracy, are only evidence against the person who
made them. What are the facts and what is the truth the jury
must determine from the evidence, and from that alone. If
there are any unguarded expressions in any of the instructions
which seem to assume the existence of any facts, or to be any
intimation as to what is proved, all such expressions must be
discouraged and the evidence only looked to, to determine the
facts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Court instructs the jury as a matter of law that an accessory
is he who stands by and aids, abets, or assists, or who, not being
present, aiding, abetting, or assisting, has advised, encouraged, aided
or abetted the perpetration of that <del>caime</del><ins>crime</ins>.
He who thus aids, abets, assists, advises or encourages shall be
considered as a principal and punished accordingly. Every such
accessory when a crime is committed within or without this state by
his aid or procurement in this state, may be indicted and convicted at
the same time as the principal, or before or after his conviction, and
whether the principal is convicted or amenable to justice or not, and
punished as principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the defendants attempted to overthrow the law by force
and threw the bomb, then the defendants who were in the conspiracy
were guilty of murder. If there was an Anarchistic
conspiracy, and the defendants were parties to it, they are guilty
of murder, though the date of the culmination of the conspiracy
was not fixed. If any of the defendants conspired to excite by
advice people to riot and murder, such defendants are guilty if
such murder was done in pursuance of said conspiracy; the impracticalness
of the aim of the defendants is immaterial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">Pg&nbsp;121</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Circumstantial evidence is competent to prove guilt, and
if defendants conspired to overthrow the law and Degan was
killed in consequence, the parties are guilty, and it is not necessary
that any of the defendants were present at the killing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All parties to the conspiracy are equally guilty. Circumstantial
evidence must satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt.
In such case the jury may find defendants guilty. When defendants
testified in the case they stood on the same ground as
other witnesses.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE VERDICT.</h3>

<p>The jury retired at 2:50 o&rsquo;clock Thursday, August 19. The
first intimation that an agreement had been reached was when
word was sent to the Revere house to prepare supper for the
jury, it having been understood that unless a decision as to the
fate of the prisoners was reached before 10 o&rsquo;clock, supper
would not be served at that time. Friday morning the excitement
of the crowd in front of the Criminal Court building was
something intense while the verdict was being awaited. There
was none of the joking and laughing that is heard on the only
other occasion that brings a mob to stand without those dreary
walls&mdash;the execution of a convicted criminal. Such conversations
as were held were in a low tone, and related solely to the
one topic&mdash;the probable conviction of the eight prisoners who
were waiting for the hour which was to mean life or death to
them. Both sides of the street were lined with people who
awaited anxiously for some tidings from the court within. An
army of bailiffs and policemen guarded the big doors, and the
surging masses were only kept back by sheer force. The limited
number who obtained admission to courtroom were the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">Pg&nbsp;122</a></span>

reporters and the immediate friends and relatives of the defendants.
The gaily-dressed women who had attended the trial
since the start were not there. The court officials decided that
the relatives of the prisoners should be allowed in the courtroom,
and at 9:15 o&rsquo;clock the sister of Spies, with another young
woman, made her appearance. Shortly afterward the mother
of Spies, accompanied by a younger son, also entered the courtroom
and took a seat on the back benches. At 9:20 Mrs. Parsons
entered the courtroom, accompanied by a woman who
attended her throughout the trial. She was given a seat between
two policemen. The row of seats farthest removed from
the judge were occupied by a force of police officers. Next below,
seated in the order named, were Henry Spies; Mrs. Spies,
the prisoner&rsquo;s mother; Miss Spies; Chris Spies, and a young
lady friend. Next below was Mrs. Martin. The ladies looked
anxious. Mrs. and Miss Spies and Mrs. Parsons looked worn
out, though the latter tried to appear unconcerned, and occupied
her time in reading newspapers. It was 9:50 o&rsquo;clock when
the Judge came in. He looked nervous and excited. He was
barely seated when Captain Black entered. The Captain took
a seat near his wife. He had just paid a visit to his clients.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they prepared for the worst?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Black,
anxiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prepared!&rdquo; repeated the Captain. &ldquo;Yes; fully prepared
to laugh at death. They talk about the matter much more
coolly than I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment or two later the prisoners were brought in.
They were not given their usual seats, but placed in a row on
a bench against the wall at the Judge&rsquo;s left, in the narrow aisle
leading to the passage way to the jail. They sat in the same

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">Pg&nbsp;123</a></span>

old order. Spies was at the head, next to the judge. All looked
<del>haggared</del><ins>haggard</ins> and excited. Even the usually
<del>stoicial</del><ins>stoical</ins> face of Lingg wore an expression
of anxiety. Fischer was deathly pale and trembled visibly. These pale
and trembling wretches were the braggarts who a few short weeks before
were boldly proclaiming the doctrines of Socialism and Anarchy on the
Lake front, in Zephf&rsquo;s hall and the beer saloons of the North and West
sides. They were the men who were advocating force and the use of
dynamite, and the total annihilation of law and order, the theft of
property, and murder of citizens. Their vapid mouthings were thrust
upon assemblages of decent working men, their policy was Communism,
their banner was the banner of blood, and their teachings were death
and destruction. Bold and fearless as lions they appeared when
indulging in flights of incendiary oratory. Like dumb, obedient beasts
they bowed in submission before the most powerful scourge the law can
wield&mdash;the death verdict.</p>

<p>The jurymen filed in and took their seats in the jury box.
They looked determined and resolute. There was a death-like
silence in the court. In a low voice the Judge asked: &ldquo;Gentlemen,
have you agreed?&rdquo; F. E. Osborne, the foreman, rose
and replied: &ldquo;We have, your honor.&rdquo; Taking out two sheets
of foolscap from his side coat-pocket, he handed them to Clerk
Doyle, who glanced at them and handed them to the Judge,
who slipped them apart, trembling so that the leaves shook
violently. A whispered consultation between the Judge and
the Clerk followed, and the document was returned to Mr.
Doyle, who read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We, the jury, find the defendants, August Spies, Michael
Schwab, Samuel Fielden, Albert R. Parsons, Adolph Fischer,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">Pg&nbsp;124</a></span>

George Engel and Louis Lingg, guilty of murder, as charged
in the indictment, and fix the penalty at death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We find the defendant, Oscar Neebe, guilty of murder in
manner and form as charged in the indictment, and fix the penalty
at imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of fifteen
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not a sound came from the spectators. For a moment the
courtroom was silent as the tomb. The prisoners were struck
with horror. Spies&rsquo; face blanched white as the paper on which
his death sentence was written. His lips quivered, and he mechanically
tapped the floor with his foot and nervously stroked
his moustache. Neebe was completely stunned. The blood
rushed to his face, and the perspiration stood out on his forehead
in great drops. Schwab&rsquo;s yellow face seemed to look into
vacancy, and he had a wandering, stupid stare. Parsons was
visibly affected, but he kept himself up better than the rest, and
maintained a certain air of nonchalance. He made an effort to
flaunt a red handkerchief out of the window at the crowd on
the outside, but was promptly checked by a bailiff. Fielden
fairly quaked. He shook like an aspen leaf, and in every way
showed his great fear. Fischer was ghastly. When the verdict
was first being read he held a half-consumed cigar in his mouth,
but when the death penalty was reached the weed fell from his
lips to the floor. Lingg appeared sullen and stoical, but when
the sentence was read his face flushed, and he was seen to tremble.
Engel betrayed no emotion. When the verdict became
known to the thousands assembled outside a great cheer rent
the air.</p>

<p>Captain Black asked that the jury be polled. The jurymen
answered with firm voices. Captain Black said he would

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">Pg&nbsp;125</a></span>

desire to make a motion for a new trial. State&rsquo;s Attorney
Grinnell said it would be impossible to dispose of the motion
during the present term, but by agreement, the motion could be
argued at the September term. This was agreed to by the
defense.</p>

<p>The Court.&mdash;&ldquo;Let the motion be entered and continued
until the next term, and let the defendants be taken back to
jail.&rdquo; Judge Gary then arose and addressed the jury as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY:&mdash;You have finished this long
and very arduous trial, which has required a very considerable
sacrifice of time, and some hardship. I hope that everything
has been done that could possibly be done to make those sacrifices
and hardships as mild as might be permitted. It does
not become me to say anything in regard to the case that you
have tried, or the verdict you have rendered; but men compulsorily
serving as jurors, as you have done, deserve some recognition
of the service you have performed besides the meager
compensation you have received.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Foreman of the jury said: &ldquo;The jury have deputed to
me the only agreeable duty, that it is in our province to perform,
and that is to thank the Court and the counsel for the defense
and for the prosecution, for your kindly care to make us as comfortable
as possible during our confinement. We thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The jury then filed out, and scarcely had they left the room
when a shrill voice was heard, and Mrs. Schwab fell heavily to
the floor. She was taken out into the fresh air by policemen,
and soon revived. Mrs. Spies followed up this scene by going
into hysterics, and also had to be assisted from the room. The
other women kept their nerves, and after the first shock maintained

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">Pg&nbsp;126</a></span>

composure. In the meantime the crowd had closed in
on the prisoners, and were examining them from head to foot.
The bailiffs, however, promptly put a stop to this, and led the
condemned men away to their cells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Behold how great a matter a little fire
kindleth!</span>&rdquo; The explosion at the Haymarket made 3 widows,
14 orphans, and left 119 children dependent upon public charity,
pending the recovery of their wounded, or perhaps permanently maimed
and crippled fathers.</p>

<p>The business men of the city and railroad corporations
promptly gave over $50,000 for the relief of the families of the
officers who were killed and wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">Pg&nbsp;131</a></span></p>

<h3>THE CONSPIRACY.</h3>

<p>The search for, and the capture of the
<del>primef-actors</del><ins>prime-actors</ins> in the Haymarket
tragedy was at once commenced in earnest. The well organized and
efficient force of brave men, under command of cool headed and
well skilled officers, was sure to succeed. Captain F. Schaack,
with six detectives, kept the entire Northwest group under the
<del>surveillance</del><ins>surveillance</ins> of their argus eyes.
Thielen turned informer and communicated important information
which fitted exactly to supply a perfect chain of evidence. The
<del>Yipsilon</del><em><ins>Ypsilon</ins></em> and <em>Ruhe</em> signals were
significant evidence toward proving conspiracy along with the other
daily developments <del>in</del>in the case. Several officers and
detectives were detailed to make a search of several houses on Sedgwick
street, among which, one Seliger&rsquo;s, at No. 442. As the officers
were nearing the house, Louis Lingg and one, Oppenheimer, were watching
them with much interest and discussing the practicability of making a
rush for their arms and kill the officers rather than have the arsenal
of the Anarchist, with its appliances for the manufacture of infernal
machines for the <del>consumation</del><ins>consummation</ins> of
conspiracy and treason, fall into the hands of the officers of the law.
But the ever vigilant officers secured possession of the house and
removed all suspicious articles to the station. Lingg went immediately
into hiding, but was on the 14 of May arrested in a little cottage
on Ambrose street. Seliger was arrested in Meyer&rsquo;s carpenter
shop, and Thielen coming to see what Seliger was arrested for was also
taken into custody. Lingg became reckless and defiant. Many of the
conspirators were run to earth by those six men and arrested. Assistant
State&rsquo;s Attorney Furthman interviewed the prisoners in their
native tongue and made a record of their statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">Pg&nbsp;132</a></span></p>

<h3>RUDOLPH SCHNAUBELT,</h3>

<p>who it is now believed was the man who threw the dynamite
bomb with such deadly effect, was once arrested, but on temporary
release decamped at once, which suspicious action led to
a further investigation. But two weeks having elapsed since
his release, he made good his escape from the country no doubt.
About forty Socialists were arrested and discharged again.
Neebe was once discharged and re-arrested as the case developed.
Gilmer&rsquo;s evidence some days after the riot tended very
much to strengthen the belief that Schnaubelt was the party
who threw the bomb, and that it was thrown under the immediate
supervision and by the direction of August Spies, which
is in keeping with his public speech and the secret teachings
by which he was endeavoring to establish, that system of revolutionary
warfare supplemented by the organization known as
the <cite>Lehr und Wehr Verein</cite>, which is synonymous with armed
protection, or teaching secretly the use of weapons for the purpose
of defense.</p>

<h3>THE GRAND JURY.</h3>

<p>The following is an abstract of their report:</p>

<p>TO THE HON. JUDGE JOHN G. ROGERS: In presenting the
bills of indictments which we have the honor herewith to submit,
in what are known as the &ldquo;Anarchist cases,&rdquo; we deem it
proper to accompany the same with a few words of explanation.
We have endeavored in our deliberations and in our findings to
be guided strictly by the instructions delivered to us by the Court
in regard to the liability of a citizen under the law for the
abuse of the privilege of free speech. We have in this connection,
upon the evidence adduced, found true bills only against

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">Pg&nbsp;133</a></span>

such persons as had, in their abuse of this right, been more or
less instrumental in causing the riot and bloodshed at Haymarket
square, the particulars of which we were called upon to
investigate. We have in some cases refused to find bills for
the reason that persons against whom evidence was presented
seemed to be the weak and ignorant tools of designing men, and
that it was our belief should they continue their evil associations
and practices after this calamity shall have shown them to what
it leads, that some future grand jury would give their cases
proper attention. So far as we are informed this is the first
appearance of dynamite as a factor in the criminal annals of this
state, and this is also the first organized conspiracy for the destruction
of human life, and the overthrow of law in any part
of this country that has employed this new and dangerous
agency. It is not surprising that the fatal and appalling success
which has attended this, its first introduction, should have inspired
terror in this community.</p>

<p>We find that the attack on the police on May 4 was the result
of a deliberate conspiracy, the full details of which are now
in the possession of the officers of the law, and will be brought
out when the cases shall be reached in court. We find that
this force of disorganizers had a very perfect force of organizers
of its own, and that it was chiefly under the control of the coterie
of men who were connected with the publication of their English
and German newspaper organs, the <cite>Alarm</cite> and <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite>. The evidence has shown conclusively to us that these
men were manipulating this agitation from base and selfish
motives, for the power and influence which it gave them, and
for the money which they could make out of it; that the large
majority of their followers were simply their dupes, and they

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">Pg&nbsp;134</a></span>

have collected in this way large sums of money from those followers,
and from the working men of this city. That their plan
was to involve, so far as they could, not only the Socialist and
Communist organizations, with whom they claim some kindred,
but also the labor societies and trades unions, to the end that
in the midst of the excitement they were creating they could not
only rely upon them as a source of revenue, but also have them
to fall back upon in the event of their finally being made amenable
to the law. Witnesses have come before us under protest
and with fear and trembling lest their appearance before this
jury should draw down upon them or upon their families the
secret vengeance of this unknown enemy. Branches of industry
in the city have remained paralyzed after all causes of disagreement
between the employer and the employed had been adjusted,
by the same fear inspired among the workmen, coupled
with the feeling that the law as administered was impotent to
afford protection to a man ready and willing to work for the
support of his family. So exaggerated has been the popular
notion as to the magnitude of this force that politicians have
cringed before it, and political parties have catered to its vote.
Processions have been tolerated upon our public streets carrying
banners and inscriptions which were a shame and a disgrace
to our city, and an affront to every law-abiding citizen. Public
harangues have been permitted that were an open menace to
law and order, and which in logical sequence have reached their
culmination in the bloody outrage known as the Haymarket
massacre. We believe that a proper enforcement of the law,
as expounded by your Honor in the charge made to this Grand
Jury at the beginning of its session, would restore confidence,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">Pg&nbsp;135</a></span>

correct existing evils, preserve the peace, and protect this community
from the recurrence of a like disorder.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we desire, as citizens and as members of this
Grand Jury, in this public way to express our most grateful acknowledgments
of the debt owing to the officers and men of the
police force of Chicago. By their heroic bravery and their conscientiousness
and devotion to duty we believe that they have
saved this city from a scene of bloodshed and devastation equal
to, or perhaps greater than that witnessed during the Commune
in Paris. We wish further, from the evidence that has been
placed before us, to express our fullest confidence that the same
force that has protected us by its bravery in the face of the enemy,
aided by the skill and legal ability of our Prosecuting
Attorney and his assistants, is quite competent to hunt these
public enemies down, and to bring them before our courts of
law with sufficient evidence of guilt to insure what they so
richly deserve.</p>

<p>Wednesday, May 19, there appeared before the grand jury
as a witness one Krendl, who is in the service of the City Water
Department. This witness, it was said, testified that he saw a
machinist, whose name was withheld, talking with Spies and
Schwab at the Haymarket the evening of the tragedy. The
witness watched the trio closely and saw them go toward Halsted
street and then return to the wagon so frequently referred
to in connection with the massacre. Upon their return the
witness noticed that the machinist had something in his right
coat-pocket which filled it up as an apple or base-ball might.
His attention was directed to this fact because of the persistent
manner in which the machinist kept guard over the mouth of
the pocket with his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">Pg&nbsp;136</a></span></p>

<p>M. M. Thompson followed the above witness, and described
a certain person who was with Schwab and Spies during the
early part of the evening, and this, in connection with Krendl&rsquo;s
testimony, was considered important by the jury. It was stated
at the time that Krendl was able to give the machinist&rsquo;s name,
from having once been a Socialist.</p>

<p>It was afterward discovered that Schnaubelt was the machinist
referred to. Fred. P. Rosbeck, a manufacturer of light machinery at
No. 224 East Washington street, stated that Schnaubelt had been in
his employ about five weeks previous to the Haymarket riot. He was a
good workman, but a pronounced Socialist and Anarchist, and his rabid
<del>utterences</del><ins>utterances</ins> had many others in the shop
to incline to his views. Schnaubelt had a companion, August Lambrecht
by name, who came to work for Rosbeck about the same time he did. They
were very intimate, going and coming together, and carrying on a close
relationship. Tuesday, May 4, Schnaubelt asked his employer for the
day, saying he had some important business to attend to. He was granted
a leave of absence, but returned to work promptly Wednesday morning.
Seeking to enlist him in conversation, Mr. Rosbeck said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rudolph, they had a big time at the Haymarket last night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Schnaubelt, &ldquo;a devil of a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Intending to further draw him out, the employer continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You Anarchists didn&rsquo;t half do your job, though. Why
didn&rsquo;t you use more bombs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;they didn&rsquo;t get up with them in
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening Rosbeck told this story to a friend, who informed
the detective, and the arrest was made Thursday morning.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">Pg&nbsp;137</a></span>

Wednesday Schnaubelt had a heavy beard and moustache.
At the time of his arrest Thursday he had no beard and his
moustache had been trimmed close to his lip. After his release
by the police Schnaubelt returned to the shop and resumed
work, but that Thursday night he informed Rosbeck that he
might not return the next day. He said that he feared the
detectives might search his house and then arrest him. He said
Mrs. Schwab was his sister, and he was often at her house. If
they searched Schwab&rsquo;s house it might lead to his (Schnaubelt&rsquo;s)
arrest. He has not been seen since that Thursday night. His
tools and clothes remained in the shop, as also did his unpaid
wages. Rosbeck thought Lambrecht had knowledge of his
friend&rsquo;s whereabouts. About the middle of May Lambrecht
informed Rosbeck that Schnaubelt had instructed him to draw
his salary and take possession of his clothes.</p>

<p>In his evidence before the jury M. M. Thompson declared
that he saw either Spies or Schwab&mdash;and he felt almost certain
it was the latter&mdash;hand Schnaubelt the bomb while the trio
were about fifteen feet from the wagon. Schnaubelt, he said,
was in waiting for them when they came from Halsted street.
Krendl testified that in his opinion Schnaubelt could not have
been handed the bomb at the place designated, because he saw
him go to Halsted street with the speakers, and return. He admitted,
however, that Schnaubelt had something in his outside
pocket when near the wagon.</p>

<p>Schnaubelt, when arrested by Detective Palmer, admitted
to Lieutenant Shea that he was with Schwab that Tuesday
night, but insisted that he left the wagon on which they were
standing when it commenced to rain.</p>

<p>Various rumors as to Schnaubelt&rsquo;s whereabouts were received.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">Pg&nbsp;138</a></span>

A letter, said to be in the fugitive&rsquo;s handwriting, was
received by the police some weeks after the riot, from Portland,
Oregon. The writer poked fun at the chief and said that the
fact that he was so far away was due to the stupidity of the
detective force and Lieut. Shea&rsquo;s gullibility.</p>

<p>Subsequently the body of a man was found in the canal at
Erie, Pa., which in features and in the clothes upon it corresponded
to the description of Schnaubelt, and it was thought he
had left Chicago as a stowaway in a vessel and had been
drowned in trying to get ashore at Erie at night. The authorities,
however, became convinced that this was not Schnaubelt.
Some of the police have always believed that Schnaubelt left
the city with Parsons the night after the bomb-throwing, and
after remaining in hiding with the latter near Omaha until Parsons
decided to appear and stand trial, continued his flight
South or West. September 15, 1886, H. F. Schaffer, a conductor
on the Mexican Central Railroad, on his way to his home
in Ohio, called on Chief of Police Ebersold and informed him
that from a picture of Schnaubelt in the <cite>Police News</cite>, he
thought he had identified the fugitive in the person of a jeweler
in the City of Mexico, who spoke English with a German accent.
Mr. Schaffer and a companion visited the jeweler frequently
and endeavored to draw him out upon the subject of
the Haymarket massacre, but the suspected person would not
talk about the Anarchists. It is understood the police took
measures to investigate this supposed clue.</p>

<h3>COST OF THE ANARCHIST TRIALS.</h3>

<p>It is estimated that the trials of the Anarchist conspirators
for connection with the Haymarket massacre has cost Cook
county and Chicago about $100,000. A calculation made by
county officials at the close of the murder trial in August,
placed the average cost since the night of the bomb-throwing
at $24,800 per month. Another estimate itemizes the daily
expenses as follows:</p>

<div class="center">
   <table summary="trial costs">
      <tr>
         <td>
            State&rsquo;s Attorney&rsquo;s office, stenographers, messengers,
            telegrams, interpreters, extra legal help (Mr. Ingham)
         </td>
         <td class="right">$200</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>
            Sheriff&rsquo;s office, bailiff&rsquo;s, jury fees, hotel bills for jury, etc.
         </td>
         <td class="right">150</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Court Costs, Judge&rsquo;s salary, miscellaneous items</td>
         <td class="right">100</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Detectives, policemen, witness fees</td>
         <td class="right">150</td>
     </tr>
      <tr>
         <td>Criminal Court Clerk&rsquo;s office and other expenses</td>
         <td class="right">100</td>
      </tr>
   </table>
</div>

<p>This makes a total of $700 a day, or $70,000 for the 100
days which the trial covered. The trials of the twenty-six
persons indicted for conspiracy in connection with the murders
bring the total cost up to $100,000.</p>

<p>In an interview Chief of Police Ebersold praised the brave
and steady action of the police at the Haymarket, but for quick
and active fighting gave the palm to the six officers who held a
mob of two or three thousand men at bay at the McCormick
works the day before the Haymarket affair. A mob tried to
hang Officer Casey to a lamp post, and he fought hand to hand

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">Pg&nbsp;140</a></span>

against great odds until rescued. Vaclav Dejnek, Frank Broda
and a young man named Hess were indicted for this affair, and
Dejnek was sentenced to serve one year in state&rsquo;s prison.</p>

<h3>THE ARBEITER ZEITUNG.</h3>

<p>The <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, which was suppressed the morning
after the riot, was re-issued almost immediately, and in one issue
had the following comments on the trial:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has it come to this, in the land of Washington, Franklin
and Jefferson? It is the Iron Must of historic development.
Only those men who are economically independent can be truly
free. Where there are poor and rich political freedom is a
wretched lie. Mammon, the powerful idol, lowers freedom to
a kitchen wench. As in Rome at the time of its decay Pr&aelig;torian
bands of foreigners upheld the rule of the C&aelig;sars, so now
the chief support of the money kings is the police force of the
large American cities, which consists mainly of foreigners. The
downfall of the Republic is nigh. It will fall like all countries
whose foundations crumble away in the course of time.
All the weeping and wailing cannot delay catastrophe. The
present is without hope, so we must strengthen ourselves by
looking at the future. A new life will bloom from the ruins
of the present social order. The society of the future will
bridge over the abysses which open to-day before our eyes. All
men will be equal. They will remember with a shudder the
time when Pr&aelig;torian bands could plot the massacre of thousands.
Mammon will be cast down from his usurped throne,
and Freedom will take the place with conquering power, to
dwell with happy humanity forever and ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the verdict was rendered Mr. Grinnell, in behalf of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">Pg&nbsp;141</a></span>

the State, sent word to the new publishers of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>,
that care must be taken by them that no attacks either on
the jury or Judge Gary should appear in their paper, notifying
them that if any such article should appear, the managers of
the paper would be prosecuted for contempt of court.</p>

<p>The following was the result of the warning:</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;OUTRAGEOUS!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Seven of the defendants
sentenced to death, and neebe gets fifteen years.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p class="center">&ldquo;A Motion for a New Trial Made!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The jury, through Osborne, its foreman, presented their
verdict to Judge Gary this morning. When the result became
known the detectives, who mingled freely with the crowd on
the street, set up a loud cheering, and the judge became very
pale&mdash;he did not expect such a demonstration. Grinnell, on
the other hand, evidently expected such a verdict, and presumably
with cause. Marshall Field and men of his stripe have
entirely too much money. What do the people say to this verdict?
They will look upon it as being impossible&mdash;incredible.
We were not inclined to believe it at first, but we soon became
convinced. Captain Black instantly made a motion for a new
trial, which Grinnell did not oppose, and Judge Gary will hear
this motion next term. If he overrules the motion, an appeal
will be taken. We are not in a proper frame of mind to say
more to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE VERDICT</h3>

<p>fell like a bolt of lightning into the midst of Socialistic and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">Pg&nbsp;142</a></span>

Anarchistic circles, believing as they did, that punishment could
only be inflicted upon the perpetrator of the act of hurling the
bomb. No wonder that consternation sat darkly upon each
sullen brow like the pall of impending doom, as slowly from the
jury came those words of fearful import which set them face to
face with death, the verdict was applauded by the foreign and
American press. Twenty-five representatives of reputable labor
unions met condemning the action of the Socialists and thereby
endorsing the verdict of the jury.</p>

<p>The Socialists of New York held indignation meetings denouncing
the verdict and expressing sympathy with their unfortunate
brethren of Chicago. Mrs. Black, in a letter dated Sept.
22, prophesied that in case the sentence was executed widespread
revolution and destruction of property and life would
immediately be inaugurated. On the 27th Capt. Black served
a notice upon State&rsquo;s Attorney Grinnell for a new trial, on the
ground that the verdict was not in keeping with the law; also
that the court had allowed improper testimony, and had erred
in his instructions. 1,191 men were called to serve as jurors in
the case before the twelve eligible men were secured, and even
then it was claimed by the defense that only ten of the twelve
were competent.</p>

<p>On Friday, Oct. 1st, the Attorneys for the defense began
their arguments for a new trial, drawing largely upon their imaginations
to supply evidence in the case. They endeavored to
introduce false affidavits from one Orrin Blossom, of No. 2,961
Wentworth Avenue, and A. Love, of La Grange, to impeach the
testimony of Gilmer. But the wary State&rsquo;s Attorney Grinnell
had one move to make which blocked their game. He had
counter affidavits from Orrin Blossom and Love proving that

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">Pg&nbsp;143</a></span>

Love was not in the city on the night of the Haymarket riot
after six o&rsquo;clock, and that he never saw <em>Harry Gilmer</em>.</p>

<p>Three days were spent by the defense in arguing their
claims for a new trial, and on October 7th Judge Gary rendered
his decision in the case in the following language:</p>

<h3>THE MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL OVERRULED.</h3>

<p>Judge Gary said:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;In passing upon this motion for a new trial the case is
   so voluminous, there is such a mass of evidence, that it is
   impossible, within anything like reasonable limits, to give a
   synopsis or epitome. I do not understand that either upon the
   trial before the jury or upon the arguments of this motion
   before me there have been any arguments tending or intended to
   deny that all of the defendants, except Neebe, were parties
   to whatever purpose or object there was in view&mdash;that
   the other seven were combined for some purpose. I, of course,
   do not wish to attribute to the defendants&rsquo; counsel any
   admissions which they have not made, but my impression is that
   there has been no argument tending or intending to deny that
   all the other seven, except Neebe, were engaged in the pursuit
   of some object. What it is, the counsel have debated before
   the jury and before me. Now, it is important to know what
   that object was, whether it was as counsel for defense have
   stated&mdash;merely to encourage working men to resist, if
   unlawful attacks were made upon them&mdash;or whether it was
   something else. There is no better way to ascertain what the
   object was, than to read what they have spoken and written as
   the object, while the events were transpiring. Now, from the
   files of their newspapers, which go back a good way, a good
   deal can be taken,

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">Pg&nbsp;144</a></span>

   which must of necessity be taken as the truth of what their
   object was. I have not had time and opportunity to arrange
   either the translations of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>
   or the files of the <cite>Alarm</cite>, and pick out those
   which in the fullest shape show what they were proposing to
   do. These translations from the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>
   now come to my hands for the first time. I have here a
   translation of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, January 11,
   1885, headed &lsquo;To Arms&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Court proceeded to read numerous and lengthy extracts
from translations offered in evidence of articles in the <cite>Arbeiter
Zeitung</cite>, in which revolution by force was advised, and the approaching
revolution, it was declared, would be greater than
that of the last century. Among the extracts read were the
following:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dynamite! Of all stuff, this is the stuff.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;The day draws near when the working people of America, in
   an outburst of passion and ungovernable rage, will revolt and
   demand the total abolition of the existing state of things
   which brings to the working classes so much misery and death.
   Have you all prepared yourselves with knives, pistols, guns
   and dynamite for the unavoidable conflict between labor and
   capital?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;It was decided at the last mass-meeting at No. 54 West
   Lake street that the next meeting will be devoted to the
   consideration of the military laws and necessity of using
   force in the warfare between capital and labor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Each working man ought to have been armed long ago.
   Daggers, revolvers and explosives are cheap, and can be easily
   obtained.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">Pg&nbsp;145</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Those who want to talk to capitalists in earnest must be
   prepared to attain their object by killing them. This can only
   be accomplished by systematic organization. The time for all
   this is short&mdash;look out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to all this,&rdquo; continued Judge Gary,
&ldquo;there is the testimony of witnesses that there was a combination
which was formed as early as 1884, and that combination had for its
purpose the changing of the existing order of things, the overthrow
of government, and the abolition of all law. There can be no question
in the mind of any one who has read these articles or heard these
speeches, which were written and spoken long before the eight-hour
movement was talked of, that this movement which they advocated was but
a means in their estimation toward the ends which they sought, and that
the movement itself was not primarily any consideration with them at
all. The different papers and speeches furnish direct contradiction to
the arguments of counsel that they proposed to resort to arms merely
to resist any unlawful attacks which the police might make upon them,
because these all show that their object was this: If, during the
eight-hour movement, strikes <del>occured</del><ins>occurred</ins>, and
if the employers chose to employ other men in the place of those who
had struck, then these men so employed must be prevented by force from
going to work, and if the police then undertook to resist the force so
employed on behalf of the strikers; if the police undertook to prevent
this force from being so employed, then that was the ground on which
the police force was to be destroyed. There can be no doubt that that
was an unlawful combination. It is impossible to argue that any set of
men have the right to dictate to others whether they should work or
not, and if they chose to work in defiance of their dictation, drive
them away by force, and if the police

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">Pg&nbsp;146</a></span>

undertook to prevent that force, then kill the police. It is impossible
for an instant to support any such principle as that. The members of
this combination publicly announce that they had no hope of winning
the majority over to their side by argument, and no hope of attaining
their object by getting rid of this majority by violence. There is no
doubt that seven of the defendants were in the combination formed for
that purpose. As to Neebe&rsquo;s part, there is the evidence of witnesses
that he presided at meetings called by the class of people from whom
this combination was drawn, and that he called meetings of the people
who were engaged in the movement. There is evidence that he marched in
the Board of Trade procession, the object of which was said to be the
demolition of that building.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Court proceeded to discuss all the evidence against
Neebe, which tended to show that he was associated with the
rest of the defendants in the encouragement of the movement
which had for its object the destruction of the government.
The Court resumed:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;On the question of the instructions whether these
   defendants, or any of them, did anticipate or expect the
   throwing of the bomb on the night of the 4th of May, is not a
   question which I need to consider, because the instructions
   did not go upon that ground. The jury were not instructed
   to find them guilty if they believed that they participated
   in the throwing of the bomb, or encouraged or advised the
   throwing of that bomb, or had knowledge that it was to be
   thrown, or anything of that sort. The conviction has not gone
   upon the ground that they did have any actual participation in
   the act which caused the death of Deegan, but upon the ground,
   under the instructions, that they had generally by speech and
   print advised a large

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">Pg&nbsp;147</a></span>

   class to commit murder, and had left the occasion, time
   and place to the individual will, whim and caprice of the
   individuals so advised, and that in consequence of that
   advice, and in pursuance of it, and influenced by it, somebody
   not known did throw the bomb that caused Deegan&rsquo;s death.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;There is no example in the law books of a case of this
   sort. No such occurrence has ever happened before in the
   history of the world. I suppose that in the Lord George Gordon
   riots we might find something like this. Lord George Gordon
   was indicted for treason, and the government failed in its
   proof upon the trial as to what he had done. Very likely they
   did not want to prove it very strongly against him; I do not
   know; it is none of my business. If the bomb was thrown in
   pursuance of the prisoners&rsquo; advice, the instruction as to
   the law of accessories before the fact applied to the case,
   and the instruction to the jury was proper. If the radical
   Prohibitionists should make up their minds that the only way
   to stop the liquor traffic was by destroying the saloons and
   killing the saloon-keepers, and if some crank should blow
   up a saloon with a bomb for whose manufacture the radicals
   had furnished specific directions, and in the explosion a
   saloon-keeper was killed, there could be no question but that
   the radical temperance men were guilty of murder. But there
   was no question that when some one said &lsquo;Hang McCormick,&rsquo; or
   &lsquo;Hang Gould,&rsquo; the reply was given to make no idle threats, but
   when they got ready to do anything, to do it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The shorthand report of the speeches of Spies, Parsons and
Fielden at the Haymarket meeting was then read, after which
the Court said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">Pg&nbsp;148</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Now, the general advice throughout was to each
   individual-man&mdash;I mean the general teachings on
   this subject of associated revolution&mdash;was to each
   individual-man to do it himself, without combination; that
   men working together in deeds of violence were to be avoided;
   that they were to go alone where one man only was required to
   accomplish the work, and where more than one man was required,
   as few as was necessary should be taken. Now, under these
   circumstances, in the inflamed state of the public mind at
   the time, each of these orators was still more inflaming the
   public mind when he advised the people to use force, and some
   man&mdash;I do not say identified, but unidentified&mdash;some
   man in that crowd, when the police approached, with a bomb of
   Lingg&rsquo;s manufacture, killed Deegan; all who have advised such
   action are guilty of his murder. If anything can be proved by
   circumstantial evidence, that is proved; that he threw that
   bomb in consequence of the influence of these teachings, this
   advise by speech and printing over a course of two years; that
   the man who threw that bomb had been educated up to it by the
   teachings of these defendants. The case, as I said before, is
   unprecedented. There is no example of any such crime having
   been committed; there is no precedent of any case like this
   having become the subject of judicial investigation; but the
   principle of law is well fixed. It is the boast of people who
   profess to admire the common law, that it adapts itself to
   human events, and that no situation or no new form of industry
   can arise but the common law has principles which may be
   applied.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The prisoners spoke in their own behalf before sentence
was passed. The courtroom was crowded as usual. The police
department was represented by Chief Ebersold, Capt. Schaack,
and twenty officers. The prisoners wore a look of even greater
anxiety than at the morning session. Parsons appeared particularly

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">Pg&nbsp;149</a></span>

thoughtful and gloomy. The greater part of the session
he sat with his cheek resting in his hand and taking less note
of the proceedings than usual. Spies was laboring under great
excitement. Before he began his speech Judge Gary repeated
the caution he had before given the auditors to refrain from any
demonstration of approbation or disapprobation during the session.
He insisted that every one in the court should be seated,
and seeing two men at the rear of the room seated on a table he
compelled them to take chairs or sit on the floor. Everything
was quiet as the grave when Spies began his address. During
the impassioned passages he raised his voice and indulged in
violent gesticulation. Neebe&rsquo;s utterance was quite rapid, and
he spoke like one at home before an audience. His speech
would have produced an impression on any jury. His voice is
clear and resonant, and he has a better presence than any of the
other defendants. Fischer spoke hesitatingly, and would probably
not have spoken at all but for an uncontrollable desire to
express his opinion of the State&rsquo;s Attorney and all representatives
of the law. Lingg&rsquo;s rather handsome face was flushed,
and his eyes flashed as he poured out his denunciation of Messrs.
Grinnell and Bonfield. When he took his seat his face was
covered with perspiration. He made the walls ring, and as
each sentence had to be translated by Prof. Ficke, he had ample
opportunity to deliver each sentence with renewed emphasis.
Schwab read his speech in a clear, resonant voice, and it had
been evidently prepared with much care.</p>

<h3>AUGUST SPIES.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;In addressing this Court I speak as the representative of
   one class to the representative of another. I will begin with
   the words uttered five hundred years ago on a similar occasion
   by the Venetian Doge Faliero, who, addressing the court, said:
   &lsquo;My defense is your accusation; the causes of my alleged
   crime, your history.&rsquo; I have been indicted under the charge
   of murder as an accomplice or accessory. Upon this indictment
   I have been convicted. There was no evidence produced by the
   State to show or even indicate that I had any knowledge of the
   man who threw the bomb, or that I myself had anything to do
   with the throwing of the missile unless, of course, you weigh
   the testimony of the accomplices of the State&rsquo;s Attorney and
   Bonfield, the testimony of Thompson and Gilmer, by the price
   they were paid for it. If there was no evidence to show that I
   was legally responsible for the deed, then my conviction and
   the execution of the sentence are nothing less than a willful,
   malicious and deliberate murder&mdash;as foul a murder as may
   be found in the annals of religious, political, or any other
   sort of persecution. Judicial murders have in many cases been
   committed where the representatives of the state were acting
   in good faith, believing their victims to be guilty of the
   charge or accusation. In this case the representatives of the state cannot
   justify themselves by a similar excuse, for they themselves
   have fabricated most of the testimony which was used as a
   pretense to convict us&mdash;convict us by a jury picked to
   convict before this Court and before the public, which is
   supposed to be the State. I charge the State&rsquo;s Attorney and
   Bonfield with a heinous conspiracy to commit murder.</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;I will now state a little incident which will
   throw light upon this charge. On the evening on which the
   <del>pr&aelig;torian</del><ins>Pr&aelig;torian</ins> cohorts
   of the Citizens&rsquo; Association, the Bankers&rsquo;
   Association, the Bar Association, and railroad princes attacked
   the meeting of working men at the Haymarket with murderous
   intent&mdash;on that evening about 8 o&rsquo;clock, I met a
   young man, Legner by name. My brother was with me at the same
   time, and never left me on that evening until I jumped from
   the wagon a few seconds before the explosion came. Legner knew
   that I had not seen Schwab that evening. He knew that I had
   no such conversation with anybody, as Marshall Field&rsquo;s
   protege, Thompson has testified to. He knew that I did not
   jump from the wagon and strike a match and hand it to the man
   who threw the bomb. He is not a Socialist. Why didn&rsquo;t we
   bring him on the stand? Because the honorable representatives
   of the State, Grinnell and Bonfield, spirited him away. These
   honorable gentlemen knew everything about Legner. They knew
   that his testimony would prove the perjury of Thompson and
   Gilmer beyond any reasonable doubt. Legner&rsquo;s name was
   on the list of witnesses for the State. He was not called,
   however, for obvious reasons. First, as he stated to a number
   of friends, he had been offered $500 if he would leave the
   city, and threatened with direful things if he should remain
   here and appear as a witness for the defense. He replied that
   he could neither be bought nor bulldozed

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">Pg&nbsp;152</a></span>

   to serve such a foul, damnable, dastardly plot. But when
   we wanted Legner he could not be found. Mr. Grinnell
   said&mdash;and Mr. Grinnell is an honorable man&mdash;that he
   himself had been searching for the young man, but had not been
   able to find him. About three weeks later I learned that the
   very same young man had been kidnapped and taken to Buffalo,
   N. Y., by two of the illustrious guardians of the law, two
   Chicago detectives. Let Mr. Grinnell, let the Citizens&rsquo;
   Association, his employer, let them answer for themselves,
   and let the people&mdash;let the public&mdash;sit in judgment
   upon these would-be assassins. No, I reply, the Prosecution
   has not established our legal guilt, notwithstanding the
   purchased and perjured testimony of some, and notwithstanding
   the originality of the proceedings of the trial. And as long
   as this has not been done, and you pronounce the sentence of
   the appointed vigilante committee acting as a jury, I say that
   you, the alleged servant and high priests of the law, are the
   real and only law-breakers, and in this case you go to the
   extent of murder. It is well that the people know this. And
   when I speak of the people I do not mean the few conspirators
   of Grinnell, the noble patricians who are murderers of those
   whom they please to oppress. Those citizens may constitute
   the state. They may control the state; they may have their
   Grinnells, Bonfields, and their hirelings. No, when I speak of
   the people, I speak of the great mass of working beasts, who
   unfortunately are not yet conscious of the rascalities that
   are perpetrated in the name of the people&mdash;in their name.
   They condemn the murder of eight men whose only crime is that
   they have dared to speak the truth. This murder may open the
   eyes of these suffering millions, may wake them up indeed. I
   have noticed that our conviction has worked miracles in this
   direction

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">Pg&nbsp;153</a></span>

   already. The class that clamors for our lives, the good and
   devout Christians, have attempted in every way, through their
   newspapers and otherwise, to conceal the true and only issue
   in this case, by designating the defendants Anarchists and
   picturing them as a newly-discovered tribe or species of
   cannibals, by inventing shocking and horrifying stories of
   their conspiracies.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I believe with Buckle, with Paine, with Jefferson, with
   Emerson, with Spencer, and with many other great thinkers
   of this century, that the state of caste and classes, the
   state where one class dominates and lives upon the labor of
   another class and calls it order, should be abolished. Yes,
   I believe that this barbaric form of social organization,
   with its legalized thunder and murder, is doomed to die and
   make room for free society&mdash;volunteer associations if
   you like&mdash;universal brotherhood. You may pronounce your
   sentence upon me, honorable judge, but let the world know
   that in the year A. D. 1886, in the state of Illinois, eight
   men were sentenced to death because they had not lost their
   faith in the ultimate victory of liberty and justice. Read the
   history of Greece and Rome; read that of Venice. Look over
   the dark pages of the church and follow the thorny path of
   science. No change! No change!</p>

   <p>&ldquo;You would destroy society and civilization, as ever,
   upon the cry of the ruling classes. They are so comfortably
   situated under the prevailing system that they naturally abhor
   and fear even the slightest changes. Their privileges are
   as dear to them as life itself, and every change threatens
   these privileges. But civilization is a record whose steps
   are monuments of such changes. Without these social changes,
   always brought about against the will and against the force of
   the ruling classes, there would be no civilization. As to the
   destruction of society,

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">Pg&nbsp;154</a></span>

   which we have been accused of seeking, it sounds like one
   of &AElig;sop&rsquo;s fables&mdash;like the cunning of the
   fox. We, who have jeopardized our lives to save society from
   the fiend that has grasped her by the throat, that seeks her
   life-blood and devours her substance; we, who would heal her
   bleeding wounds, who would free her from the fetters you have
   wrought around her, from the misery you have brought upon
   her&mdash;we are enemies. We have preached dynamite, it is
   said, and we have predicted from the lessons history has taught
   us, that the ruling class of to-day would no more listen to
   the voice of reason than did their predecessors. They would
   attempt by brute force to stay the march of progress. Was it
   a lie, or was it the truth that we stated? * * * I have been
   a citizen of this city fully as long as Mr. Grinnell, and am
   probably as good a citizen as Grinnell. At least I should not
   wish to be compared to him. Grinnell has appealed time and
   again, as has been stated by our attorneys, to the patriotism
   of the jury. To that I reply, and I will simply use the words
   of an English <del>literateur</del><ins>litterateur</ins>,
   &lsquo;Patriotism is the last resort of the scoundrel.&rsquo;
   My friends&rsquo; agitation in behalf of the disinherited and
   disfranchised millions, and my agitation in this direction,
   the popularization of the economic teachings in favor of the
   education of wage-workers, is declared to be a conspiracy
   against society. The word &rsquo;society&rsquo; is here wisely
   substituted for state, as represented by the patricians of
   to-day. It has always been the opinion of the ruling classes
   that the people must be kept in ignorance. They lose their
   <del>servility</del><ins>servility</ins>, modesty, and obedience
   to the arbitrary powers that be, as their intelligence grows.
   The education of a blackman, a quarter of a century ago was a
   criminal offense. Why? Because the intelligent slave would throw
   off his shackles

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">Pg&nbsp;155</a></span>

   at whatever cost, my Christian gentlemen. Why is the
   education of the working classes to-day looked upon by a
   certain class as treason against the State? For the same
   reason! The State, however, wisely avoided this point in
   the prosecution of the case. From their testimony one would
   really conclude that we had in our speeches and publications
   preached nothing else but destruction and dynamite. * * *
   You, gentlemen, are the revolutionists. You rebel against
   the effects of social conditions which have tossed you by
   fortune&rsquo;s hand into a magnificent paradise. Without inquiring,
   you imagine that no one else has a right in that place. You
   insist that you are the chosen ones, the sole proprietors
   of forces that tossed you into the paradise. The industrial
   forces are still at work. They are growing more active and
   intense from day to day. Their tendency is to elevate all
   mankind to the same level; to have all humanity share in the
   paradise you now monopolize. Can you roll back the incoming
   tide or angry waves of old ocean by forbidding it to dash
   upon the shore? So you can no more frighten back the rising
   waves of intelligence and progress into their unfathomable
   depths by erecting a few gallows in the perspective. You,
   who oppose the natural forces of things, you are the real
   revolutionists. You, and you alone, are the conspirators and
   destructionists.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>ADOLPH FISCHER.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Your Honor, you asked me why the sentence of death should
   not be passed upon me. I will not talk much. I will only say
   a few words, and that is that I protest against my being
   sentenced to death, because I committed no crime. I was tried
   here in this room for murder and I was convicted of Anarchy.

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">Pg&nbsp;156</a></span>

   I protest against being sentenced to death, because I have not
   been found guilty of murder. I have been tried for murder,
   but I have been convicted because I am an Anarchist. Although
   being one of the parties who were at the Haymarket meeting,
   I had no more to do with the throwing of that bomb, I had no
   more connection with it than State&rsquo;s Attorney Grinnell had
   perhaps.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/z185.jpg" width="400" height="465" alt="Adolph Fischer" />
   <div class="caption"><p>Adolph Fischer.</p></div>
</div>

   <p>&ldquo;As I said, it is a fact, and I do not deny
   that I was one of the parties who called at the Haymarket
   meeting, but that meeting&mdash;(At this point Mr. Salomon
   stepped up and spoke to Fischer in a low tone, but Fischer
   <del>waived</del><ins>waved</ins> him off and said: Mr.
   Salomon, be so kind. I know what I am talking about.) Now,
   that Haymarket meeting was not called for the purpose of
   committing violence and crime. No; but the meeting was called
   for the purpose of protesting against the outrages and against
   the crimes of the police committed on the day previous out
   at McCormick&rsquo;s. The next day I went to Wehrer &amp;
   Klein and had twenty-five thousand copies of the handbills
   printed, and I invited Spies to speak at Haymarket meeting.
   It is the fact, and I don&rsquo;t deny it, in the original
   of the &lsquo;copy&rsquo; I had the line &lsquo;Working men,
   arm!&rsquo; and I had my reasons, too, for putting those
   lines in, because I didn&rsquo;t want the working men to be
   shot down in that meeting as on other occasions. But as those
   circulars were printed and brought over to the <cite>Arbeiter
   Zeitung</cite> office, my comrade, Spies, saw one of those
   circulars. I had invited him to speak before that. He showed
   the circular and said: &lsquo;Well, Fischer, if those circulars
   are distributed I won&rsquo;t speak.&rsquo; And I admitted it
   would be better to take those lines out; and Mr. Spies spoke.
   And that is all I had to do with that meeting. I feel that I am
   sentenced, or will be sentenced

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">Pg&nbsp;157</a></span>

   to death because I am an Anarchist, and not because I am a murderer.
   I have never been a murderer. I have never committed any
   crime in my life yet; but I know a certain man who is on the
   way to becoming a murderer, an assassin, and that man is
   Grinnell&mdash;the State&rsquo;s Attorney Grinnell&mdash;because
   he brought men on the witness stand whom he knew would swear
   falsely; and I publicly denounce Mr. Grinnell as being a
   murderer and an assassin if I should be executed. But, if
   the ruling classes think that by hanging us, hanging a few
   Anarchists, they can crush out Anarchy, they will be badly
   mistaken, because the Anarchist loves his principles more
   than his life. An Anarchist is always ready to die for his
   principles.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>MICHAEL SCHWAB.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;It is not much I have to say, and I would say nothing at
   all if keeping silence did not look like a cowardly approval
   of what has been done here. To those, the proceedings of
   a trial of justice would be a sneer. Justice has not been
   done. More than that, could not be done. If one class is
   arraigned against the other class it is idle and hypocritical
   to talk about justice and fairness. Anarchy was on trial,
   as the State&rsquo;s Attorney put it in his closing speech. A
   doctrine, an opinion hostile to brute force, hostile to our
   present murderous system of production and distribution. I am
   condemned to die for writing newspaper articles and making
   speeches. The State&rsquo;s Attorney knows as well as I do that
   the alleged conversation between Mr. Spies and me never took
   place. He knows a good deal more than that. He knows all
   the beautiful works of his organizer, Furthmann. When I was
   before the Coroner&rsquo;s jury two or three witnesses swore very
   positively to having seen me

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">Pg&nbsp;158</a></span>

   at the Haymarket when Mr. Parsons finished his speech. I
   suppose they wanted at that time to fix the bomb-throwing on
   me, for the first dispatches to Europe said that M. Schwab had
   thrown several bombs at the police. Later on they found that
   would not do, and then Schnaubelt was the man. Anarchy was on
   trial. Little did it matter who the persons were to be honored
   by the prosecution. * * *</p>

   <p>&ldquo;As soon as the word is applied to us and to our doctrine
   it carries with it a meaning that we Anarchists see fit to
   give. &lsquo;Anarchy&rsquo; is Greek, and means, verbatim, that we are
   not being ruled. According to our vocabulary Anarchy is a
   state of society in which the only government is reason; a
   state of society in which all human beings do right for the
   simple reason that it is right, and hate wrong because it is
   wrong. In such a society no compulsion will be necessary. The
   Attorney of the State was wrong when he exclaimed &lsquo;Anarchy
   is dead!&rsquo; Anarchy up to the present time existed only as a
   doctrine, and Grinnell has not the power to kill any doctrine
   whatever. Anarchy, as defined by us, is called an idle dream,
   but that dream was called by God a divine blessing. One of the
   three great German poets and a celebrated German critic of the
   last century has also defined it. If Anarchy was the thing the
   State&rsquo;s Attorney makes it out to be, how could it be that such
   eminent scholars as Prince Krapotkine should say what he has
   said about it? Anarchy is a dream, but only in the present.
   It will be realized, for reason will grow in spite of all
   obstacles. Who is the man that has the cheek to tell us that
   human development has already reached its culminating point?
   I know our ideal will not be accomplished this year or next
   year, but I know it will be accomplished as soon as possible,
   some day in

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">Pg&nbsp;159</a></span>

   the future. It is entirely wrong to use the word Anarchy as
   synonymous with violence. Violence is something, and Anarchy
   is another. In the present state of society violence is used
   on all sides, and therefore we advocated the use of violence
   against violence, but against violence only as a necessary
   means of defense. I have never read Herr Most&rsquo;s book simply
   because I don&rsquo;t find time to read it; and if I had read it,
   what of it? I am an agnostic, but I like to read the Bible,
   nevertheless. I have not the slightest idea who threw the bomb
   at the Haymarket, and had no knowledge of any conspiracy to
   use violence that or any other night.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>OSCAR NEEBE.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Your Honor: I have found out during the last few days
   what law is. Before I didn&rsquo;t know it. I did not know that I
   was convicted because I knew Spies and Fielden and Parsons.
   I have met these gentlemen. I have presided at a meeting, as
   the evidence against me shows, in the Turner hall, to which
   meeting your Honor was invited. The judges, the preachers, the
   newspaper men, and everybody was invited to appear at that
   meeting for the purpose of discussing Anarchism and Socialism.
   I was at that hall. I am well known among the working men of
   the city, and I was the one elected chairman of that meeting.
   Nobody appeared to speak, to discuss the question of Labor and
   Anarchism or Socialism with laboring men. No, they couldn&rsquo;t
   stand it. I was chairman of that meeting; I don&rsquo;t deny it. I
   had the honor to be marshal of a labor demonstration in this
   city, and I never saw as respectable a lot of men as I saw
   that day.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;They marched like soldiers, and I was proud that I was

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">Pg&nbsp;160</a></span>

   marshal of those men. They were the toilers and the working
   men of this city. The men marched through the city of Chicago
   to protest against the wrongs of society, and I was marshal
   of them. If that is a crime, I have found out&mdash;as a born
   American&mdash;what I am guilty of. I always thought I had a
   right to express my opinion, to be chairman of a peaceable
   meeting, and to be marshal of a demonstration. My friends, the
   labor agitators, and the marshals of a demonstration&mdash;was
   it a crime to be marshal of a demonstration? I am convicted
   of that. I suppose Grinnell thought after Oscar Neebe was
   indicted for murder the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> would
   go down. But it didn&rsquo;t happen that way. And Mr. Furthmann,
   too&mdash;he is a scoundrel, and I can tell it to you to your
   face. There is only one man that acted as a lawyer, and he is
   Mr. Ingham, but you three fellows have not.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I established the paper and issued it to the working men
   of the city of Chicago, and inside of two weeks I had enough
   money from the toilers&mdash;from hired girls, from men who
   would take the last cent out of their pocket to establish the
   paper&mdash;to buy a press. I could not publish the paper
   because the honorable detectives and Mr. Grinnell followed us
   up, and no printing house would print our paper, and we had to
   have our own press. We published our own paper after we had
   a press, bought by the money of the working men of the city.
   That is the crime I have committed&mdash;getting men to try
   and establish a working man&rsquo;s paper that will stand to-day,
   and I am proud of it. They have not got one press&mdash;they
   have got two presses to-day, and they belong to the working
   men of this city. When the first issue came out, from that
   day up to the day now, your Honor, we have gained 4,000
   subscribers.

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">Pg&nbsp;161</a></span>

   There are the gentlemen sitting over there from
   the <cite>Freie Presse</cite> and <cite>Staats
   Zeitung</cite>&mdash;they know it. The Germans of this city
   are condemning these actions. They would not read our paper.
   There is the crime of the Germans. I say it is a verdict
   against Germans, and I, as an American, must say that I never
   saw anything like that.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Those are the crimes I have committed after the 4th
   of May. Before the 4th of May I committed some crimes. I
   organized trades unions. I was for the reduction of the
   hours of labor and the education of laboring men and the
   re-establishment of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>.
   There is no evidence to show that I was connected with the
   bomb-throwing, that I was near it or anything of that kind. So
   I am only sorry, your Honor, if you can stop it or help it, I
   will ask you to do it&mdash;that is, to hang me, too; and I
   think it is more honor to die certainly than to be killed by
   inches. I have a family and children, and if they know their
   father is dead they will bury him. They can go to the grave
   and kneel down in front of it; but they can&rsquo;t go to Joliet and
   see their father convicted of a crime that he hasn&rsquo;t anything
   to do with. That is all I have got to say. Your Honor, I am
   sorry I do not get hung with the rest of the men.&rdquo;</p>

   been brought in support of it? It has been proved that I
   assisted some man by the name of Seliger in manufacturing
   bombs. It has been furthermore stated that with the assistance
   of somebody else I have taken those bombs to 58 Clybourn

   as a State witness it has not been shown that one of these
   bombs was taken to the Haymarket. * * * What is Anarchy? * * *
   The points that we are driving at have been carefully withheld
   by the State. * * * But it has not been said that by their
   superior force we are driven to our course. Contempt of court

   of public order. What is this order? Such order as represented
   by police and detectives? On the slightest occasion the
   representatives of this public order have forced themselves

   Capt. Schaack that I was at a meeting of carpenters at Zephf&rsquo;s
   hall on May 3. He has stated that I admitted to him that I
   learned the fabrication of bombs from Most&rsquo;s book, &lsquo;Science

   persons here, of which I am one, are murdered purposely by
   Grinnell. * * * Grinnell has the courage to call me a coward,
   right here in this court of justice, and Grinnell is a person
   who has connived with miserable subjects to go against me,
   to get testimony against me, to kill me. * * * Is life worth
   living? What are their purposes in thus murdering these men?
   Low egotism, which finds its reward in a higher position, and
   which yields a return of money. * * * But

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">Pg&nbsp;163</a></span>

   it has been said that the International association of working
   men was in itself a conspiracy, and that I was a member of

   you how we were connected. * * * And that is the conspiracy
   that has been proved against me, and for that I am to end

<h3>GEORGE ENGEL.</h3>

<p class="center">[Translated by Mr. Gauss.]</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;When I left Germany in the year 1872 it was by reason
   of my recognition of the fact that I could not support
   myself in the future as it was the duty of a man to do. I
   recognized that I could not make my living in Germany because
   the machinery and the guilds of old no longer furnished me
   a guarantee to live. I resolved to emigrate from Germany to
   the United States, praised by many so highly. When I landed
   at Philadelphia, on the 8th of January, 1873, my heart and my
   bosom expanded with the expectation of living hereafter in
   that free country which had been so often praised to me by so
   many emigrants,

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">Pg&nbsp;164</a></span>

   and I resolved to be a good citizen of this country; and I
   congratulated myself on having broken with Germany, where I
   could have no longer made my living, and I think that my past
   will show that, that which I resolved I intended to keep
   faithfully. For the first time I stand before an American
   court, and at that to be at once condemned to death. And what
   are the causes that have preceded it, and have brought me
   into this court? They are the same things that preceded my
   leaving Germany, and the same causes that made me leave. I
   have seen with my own eyes that in this free country, in this
   richest country of the world, so to say, there are existing
   proletarians who are pushed out of the order of society.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After explaining how his dissatisfaction with the existing
order of things led him to become a Socialist, Engel continued:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;I resolved to study Socialism with all my power.
   In the year 1878 I came from Philadelphia to Chicago, and
   took pains to eke out my existence here in Chicago, and
   believed that it would be an easier task to live here, than in
   Philadelphia, where I had previously in vain exerted my powers
   to live. I found that, that also was in vain. There was no
   difference for a proletariat, whether he lived in New York, or
   Philadelphia, or Chicago. * * * To make further investigations
   I tried to buy, from the money that I and my family earned,
   scientific books on those questions. I bought the works of
   Ferdinand <del>LaSalle</del><ins>Lassalle</ins>, Karl Marx and
   Henry George. After investigating these works I recognized
   these reasons why a proletariat could not exist, even in this
   country, as free as it is. I thought about the means by which
   that could be corrected. They praised to me this country where
   every man and every working man had a right to go to the
   ballot-box and choose his own officers. I

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">Pg&nbsp;165</a></span>

   scarcely believed that any citizen of the United States
   could have meant so honestly and well as I, when I turned my
   attention to politics, and took part in them. But even in this
   regard of freedom of the ballot-box I found myself mistaken.
   I learned to see that the working man was not free in his
   opinion, that he was not free in vote. It was in vain that the
   Socialistic party took pains in former times, honest pains,
   to elect honest officers. After a few vain attempts I found
   that it was impossible for a working man to free himself by
   means of the ballot-box, and to secure those things which were
   necessary for his existence. * * * In this city corruption even
   entered the ranks of the Social Democracy. I also obtained
   the conviction that through those men who put themselves over
   us as leaders, and occupied themselves with compromises, this
   was brought about, and then I left the ranks of the Social
   Democracy and gave myself over to the International which was
   then organizing; and what these men wanted, and what these men
   through their exertions sought to bring about was nothing more
   or less than the conviction that the freeing of the ruling
   classes could only be brought about by force, as have all
   revolutions been throughout history. This conviction, before
   I went over to those people, was obtained through study of
   the history of all lands. The history of all lands showed me
   that all advantages in a political, in a religious, and in a
   material direction, were always obtained only by the use of
   force; and if I confine myself to the history of this country
   where I am convicted, I take into consideration that the first
   <del>emmigrants</del><ins>immigrants</ins> into this country
   and the first colonists, only freed themselves by force from
   the power of England. I afterward obtained the conviction that
   the slavery existing in this country, to the shame of the
   Republic, could

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">Pg&nbsp;166</a></span>

   only be put aside by force. And what does this history teach
   us? The man that spoke against existing slavery in this
   country was hanged, as it is intended that we should be
   hanged, to-day. In the course of time I became convinced that
   all those who spoke in favor of the ruling classes must hang.
   And what are the reasons for it? This Republic does not exist
   through, and its affairs are not conducted by, those persons
   who come into office by an honest ballot. * * * Under these
   conditions it is certainly not a wonder that there were men,
   noble men, noble scientific men, who have tried to find ways
   and means to bring back humanity to its original condition.
   And this is the social science to which I confess myself with
   joy. The State&rsquo;s Attorney said here &lsquo;Anarchism is on trial.&rsquo;
   Anarchism and Socialism are, according to my opinion, as like
   as one egg is to another. Only the tactics are different.
   Anarchism has abandoned the ways pointed out by Socialism to
   free <del>man-</del>mankind, and has resolved no longer to bear the yoke of
   slavery, and, therefore, I say to the working classes, do not
   believe any longer in the ballot-box and in those ways and
   means that are left open to you; but rather think about ways
   and means when the time comes, when the burden of the people
   becomes intolerable. And that is our crime. Because we have
   named to the people the ways and means by which they could
   free themselves in the fight against Capitalism, by reason of
   that, Anarchism is hated and persecuted in every state. In
   spite of that and again in spite of it Anarchism will exist,
   and if not in public it will exist in secret, because the
   powers force it to act in secret. If the State&rsquo;s Attorney
   declares or thinks that after he has hanged these seven men
   and sent the other one to the penitentiary for fifteen years
   he has then killed Anarchism, I say, that will not

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">Pg&nbsp;167</a></span>

   be so. Only the tactics will be changed, and that will be
   all. No power in the world will tear from the working man his
   knowledge and his skill or opportunity in making bombs. I am
   convinced that Anarchism cannot be routed out,&mdash;if that
   was the case it would have been routed out in other countries
   long ago&mdash;in the least by our murdering the Anarchists.
   That evening when the first bomb in this country was thrown,
   I was sitting in my room; did not know anything about the
   conspiracy; did not know anything about that deed; did not
   know anything about the bomb; did not know anything about the
   conspiracy which the State&rsquo;s Attorney had brought about here.
   * * * Can you have respect for a government that only gives
   rights to the privileged classes, but to the working men not
   at all, although there are conspiracies in all classes and
   connections of the capitalistic class. Although we have only
   recently experienced that the coal barons came together, put
   up the price of coal arbitrarily while they paid less wages
   to their working men, and wherever those coal workers, those
   miners have come together to consider the bettering their
   conditions, their demands have always been very modest on the
   whole, then the militia appears at once upon the scene and
   helps those people, while they are feeding the miners with
   powder and lead. For such a government I have no respect, and
   can have no respect in spite of all their followers, in spite
   of all their police, in spite of all their spies.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I am not a man who hates a single capitalist. I am not the
   man who at all hates the person of the capitalist. I hate the
   system and all privileges, and my greatest desire is that the
   working classes will at last recognize who are their friends
   and

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">Pg&nbsp;168</a></span>

   who are their enemies. Against the condemnation of myself by
   the capitalistic influence I have no word to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fielden continued:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;It makes a great deal of difference, perhaps, what kind of
   a revolutionist a man is. The men who have been on trial here
   for Anarchy have been asked the question on the witness stand
   if they were revolutionists. It is not generally considered to
   be a crime among intellectual people to be a revolutionist,
   but it may be made a crime if a revolutionist happens to be
   poor. * * * If I had known that I was being tried for Anarchy
   I could have answered that charge. I could have justified
   it under the constitutional right of every citizen of this
   country, and more than the right which any constitution
   can give, the natural right of the human mind to draw its
   conclusion from whatever information it can gain, but I had no
   opportunities to show why I was an Anarchist.

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">Pg&nbsp;169</a></span>

   I was told that I was to be hung for being an Anarchist,
   after I had got through defending myself on the charge of
   murder.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fielden related that he was born in Lancashire; that his first
speech was made to starving operatives in the streets of his native
town; that it was here he began to hate kings and queens;
his first speech was in support of the operatives of Lancashire
as against the sympathizers with the South in the American rebellion;
he came to the United States in 1868 and was a Methodist
exhorter in Ohio, and came to Chicago in 1869. Fielden
detailed how he had come to be a Socialist and Anarchist; reviewing
the various speeches he had made at meetings in Chicago;
attacking the veracity of witnesses who had testified
against him, and declaring himself the victim of illegal prosecution.
He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;From the time I became a Socialist I learned more and
   more what it was. I knew that I had found the right thing;
   that I had found the medicine that was calculated to cure the
   ills of society. Having found it, I believed it, and I had
   a right to advocate it, and I did. The Constitution of the
   United States, when it says: &lsquo;The right of free speech shall
   not be abridged,&rsquo; gives every man the right to speak. I have
   advocated the principles of Socialism and social equality,
   and for that and no other reason am I here, and sentence of
   death is to be pronounced upon me. What is Socialism? Taking
   somebody else&rsquo;s property? That is what Socialism is in the
   common acceptation of the term. No; but if I were to answer
   it as shortly and as curtly as it is answered by its enemies,
   I would say it is preventing somebody else from taking your
   property. But Socialism is equality. Socialism recognizes the
   fact that no man in society is responsible for what he is;
   that all the ills

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">Pg&nbsp;170</a></span>

   that are in society are the production of poverty; and
   scientific Socialism says that you must go to the root of
   the evil. There is no criminal statistician in the world
   but will acknowledge that all the crime, when traced to
   its origin, is the product of poverty. * * * If I am to be
   convicted&mdash;hanged for telling the truth, the little child
   that kneels by its mother&rsquo;s side on the West side to-day and
   tells its mother that he wants his papa to come home, and to
   whom I had intended as soon as its prattling tongue should
   begin to talk, to teach that beautiful sentiment&mdash;that
   child had better never be taught to read; had better never
   be taught that sentiment to love truth. If they are to be
   convicted of murder because they dare tell what they think
   is the truth, then it would be better that every one of your
   schoolhouses were reduced to the ground and one stone not left
   upon another. If you teach your children to read they will
   acquire curiosity from what they read. They will think, and
   then will search for the meaning of this and that. They will
   arrive at conclusions. And then if they love the truth, they
   must tell to each other what is truth or what they think is
   the truth. That is the sum of my offending. * * * The private
   property system then, in my opinion, being a system that only
   subserves the interests of a few, and can only subserve the
   interests of the few, has no mercy. It cannot stop for the
   consideration of such a sentiment. Naturally it cannot. So
   you ought not to have mercy upon the private property system,
   because it is well known that there are many people in the
   community with prejudices in their minds. They have grown up
   under certain social regulations, and they believe that those
   social regulations are right, just as Mr. Grinnell believes
   that everything in America is right, because he happened to be
   born

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">Pg&nbsp;171</a></span>

   here. And they have such a prejudice against any one who
   attacks those systems. Now, I say they ought not to have any
   mercy upon systems that do not subserve their interests. They
   ought not to have any respect for them that would interfere
   with their abolishing them.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fielden maintained that the throwing of the bomb at the
Haymarket was a complete surprise to him; that he felt that he
would be held in some respect, at least responsible, yet he resolved
not to attempt flight; continuing:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;I have said here that I thought when the representatives
   of the State had inquired by means of their policemen as to
   my connection with it, I should have been released. And I say
   now, in view of all the authorities that have been read on
   the law and accessory, that there is nothing in evidence that
   has been introduced to connect me with that affair. * * * The
   great Socialist who lived in this world nearly 1,900 years
   ago, Jesus Christ, has left these words, and there are no
   grander words in which the principles of justice and right are
   conveyed in any language. He said: &lsquo;Better that ninety-nine
   guilty men should go unpunished than that one innocent
   man should suffer.&rsquo; Mr. Grinnell, I should judge from his
   statements here, is a Christian. I would ask him to apply that
   statement of the Great Teacher to the different testimony that
   has been given here, and the direct contrary in other places
   in the investigation of this case. Your Honor, we claim that
   this is a class verdict. We claim that the foulest criminal
   that could have been picked up in the slums of any city in
   Christendom, or outside of it, would never have been convicted
   on such testimony as has been brought in here if he had not
   been a dangerous man in the opinion of the privileged classes.
   * * * If my life is to be taken for advocating the

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">Pg&nbsp;172</a></span>

   principles of Socialism and Anarchy, as I have understood them
   and honestly believe them to be in the interests of humanity,
   I say to you that I gladly give it up; and the price is very
   small for the result that is gained. * * * We claim that so
   far as we have been able to find out in trying to find a cure
   for the ills of society, we have not found out anything that
   has seemed to fit the particular diseases which society in our
   opinion is afflicted with to-day, better than the principles
   of Socialism. And your Honor, Socialism, when it is thoroughly
   understood in this community and in the world, as it is by
   us, I believe that the world, which is generally honest,
   prejudiced though it may be, will not be slow to adopt its
   principles. And it will be a good time, a grand day for the
   world; it will be a grand day for humanity; it will never have
   taken a step so far onward toward perfection, if it can ever
   reach that goal, as it will when it adopts the principles of
   Socialism. * * * To-day, as the beautiful autumn sun kisses
   with balmy breeze the cheek of every free man, I stand here
   never to bathe my head in its rays again. I have loved my
   fellow men as I have loved myself. I have hated trickery,
   dishonesty and injustice. The nineteenth century commits the
   crime of killing its best friend. It will live to repent of
   it. But, as I have said before, if it will do any good, I
   freely give myself up. I trust the time will come when there
   will be a better understanding, more intelligence, and above
   the mountains of iniquity, wrong and corruption, I hope the
   sun of righteousness and truth and justice will come to bathe
   in its balmy light an emancipated world. I thank your Honor
   for your attention.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>A. R. PARSONS.</h3>

<p>Parsons made a speech addressed in the main to working
men, starting out with the recital of a poem by George Heinig,
entitled &ldquo;Bread is Freedom.&rdquo; He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Your Honor, if there is one distinguishing
   characteristic which has made itself prominent in the conduct
   of this trial it has been the passion, the heat, and the anger,
   the violence both to sentiment and to feeling, of everything
   connected with this case. You ask me why sentence of death
   should not be pronounced upon me, or, what is tantamount to
   the same thing, you ask me why you should give me a new trial
   in order that I might establish my innocence and the ends
   of justice be subserved. I answer you, your Honor, and say
   that this verdict is the verdict of passion, born in passion,
   nurtured in passion, and is the sum totality of the organized
   passion of the city of Chicago. For this reason I ask your
   suspension of the sentence, and a new trial. This is one
   among the many reasons which I hope to present to your Honor
   before I conclude. Now, your Honor, what is passion? Passion
   is the suspension of reason; in a mob upon the streets, in
   the broils of the saloon, in the quarrels on the sidewalk,
   where men throw aside their reason and resort to feelings
   of exasperation, we have passion. There is a suspension of
   the elements of judgment, of calmness, of discrimination
   requisite to arrive at the truth and the establishment of
   justice. I hold, your Honor, that you cannot dispute the
   proposition that I make that this trial has been submerged,
   <del>immersed</del><ins>immersed</ins> in passion from its
   inception to its close, and even at this hour, standing here
   upon the scaffold as I do with the hangman awaiting me with
   his halter, there are those who claim to represent public
   sentiment in the city, and I now speak of the capitalistic
   press&mdash;that vile and infamous organ and monopoly of hired
   liars, the people&rsquo;s oppressors.&rdquo; Parsons claimed to

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">Pg&nbsp;174</a></span>

   have been for thirty years identified with labor interests,
   and said: &ldquo;And in what I say upon this subject relating
   to the labor movement or to myself as connected in this trial
   or before this bar, I will speak the truth, though my tongue
   should be torn from my mouth and my throat cut from ear to ear,
   so help me God.&rdquo; The speaker then went into statistics,
   claiming that 9,000,000 out of the 12,000,000 voters in the
   United States were actual wage workers. He attacked the
   citizens&rsquo; Association as an organization of millionaires,
   and claimed that the Court should stand between the accused
   and their <del>persecuters</del><ins>persecutors</ins>.
   &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;are the ends of justice
   observed, and where is truth found in hurrying seven human
   beings at the rate of express speed upon a fast train to the
   scaffold, and an ignominious death? Why, if your Honor please,
   the very method of our extermination, the deep damnation of its
   taking off, appeals to your Honor&rsquo;s sense of justice, of
   rectitude, and of honor. A judge may also be an unjust man.
   Such things have been known. We have in our histories heard of
   Lord Jeffreys. It need not follow that because a man is a judge
   he is also just. * * * Now, I hold that our execution, as the
   matter stands just now, would be judicial murder, and judicial
   murder is far worse than lynch law&mdash;far worse. But, your
   Honor, bear in mind please, this trial was conducted by a mob,
   prosecuted by a mob, by the shrieks and the howls of a mob, an
   organized powerful mob. The trial is over. Now, your Honor,
   you sit there judicially, calmly, quietly, and it is now for
   you to look at this thing from the standpoint of reason and
   from common sense. * * * Now, the money-makers, the business
   men, those people who deal in stocks and bonds, the speculators
   and employers, all that class of men known as the money-making
   class,

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">Pg&nbsp;175</a></span>

   they have no conception of this labor question; they don&rsquo;t
   understand what it means. To use the street parlance, with
   many of them it is a difficult matter for them to &lsquo;catch onto&rsquo;
   it, and they are perverse also; they will have no knowledge of
   it. They don&rsquo;t want to know anything about it, and they won&rsquo;t
   hear anything about it, and they propose to club, lock up, and
   if necessary strangle those who insist on their hearing this
   question. Now, your Honor, can you deny that there is such a
   thing in the world as the labor question? I am an Anarchist.
   Now strike! But hear me before you strike. What is Socialism,
   briefly stated? It is the right of the toiler to the free and
   equal use of the tools of production, and the right of the
   producer to their product. That is Socialism. The history
   of mankind is one of growth. It has been evolutionary and
   revolutionary.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Parsons went into an explanation of the wage question and the
relations of capital and labor, asserting that employers in owning
capital and leaving nothing to the wage slave but the price of his
work, had produced a conflict which would intensify as the power of
the <del>priviledged</del><ins>privileged</ins> classes over the
non-possession of property classes increased. He continued:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;We were told by the Prosecution that law is on trial;
   that government is on trial. That is what the gentlemen on
   the other side have stated to the jury. The law is on trial,
   and government is on trial. Well, up to the conclusion of
   this trial we, the defendants, supposed that we were indicted
   and being tried for murder. Now, if the law is on trial, and
   the government is on trial, who has placed it upon trial? And
   I leave it to the people of America whether the prosecution
   in this case have made out a case; and I charge it here now,
   frankly, that in order

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">Pg&nbsp;176</a></span>

   to bring about this conviction the Prosecution, the
   representatives of the State, the sworn officers of the
   law&mdash;those whose duty it is to the people to obey the
   law and preserve order&mdash;I charge upon them a willful, a
   malicious, a purposed violation of every law which guarantees
   every right to every American citizen. They have violated free
   speech. In the prosecution of this case they have violated a
   free press. They have violated the right of public assembly.
   Yea, they have even violated and denounced the right of
   self-defense. I charge the crime home to them. * * * My own
   deliberate opinion concerning this Haymarket affair is that
   the death-dealing missile was the work, the deliberate work of
   monopoly&mdash;the act of those who themselves charge us with
   the deed. I am not alone in this view of this matter. What
   are the real facts of that Haymarket tragedy? Mayor Harrison
   of Chicago has caused to be published his opinion, in which
   he says: &lsquo;I did not believe that there was any intention on
   the part of Spies and those men to have bombs thrown at the
   Haymarket.&rsquo; He knows more about this thing than the jury
   that sat in this room, for he knows&mdash;I suspect that the
   Mayor knows&mdash;of some of the methods by which some of
   this evidence and testimony might have been manufactured. I
   don&rsquo;t charge it, your Honor, but possibly he has had some
   intimation of it, and if he has he knows more about this case
   and the merits of this case than did the jury who sat here. *
   * * Before the trial began, during its prosecution, and since
   its close, a Satanic press has shrieked and howled itself
   wild, like ravenous hyenas, for the blood of these eight
   working men. Now, this subsidized press, in the pay of the
   monopoly and of laborers and slavers, commanded this Court and
   commanded this jury and this Prosecution

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">Pg&nbsp;177</a></span>

   to convict us. As a fitting climax to this damnable conspiracy
   against our lives and liberty, what follows? O hide your eye
   now! hide it! hide it! As a fitting climax to this damnable
   conspiracy against our lives and liberty some of Chicago&rsquo;s
   millionaires proposed to raise a purse of $100,000 and present
   it to the jury for their verdict of guilty against us.
   This was done, as everybody knows, in the last days of the
   trial, and since the verdict so far as anybody knows to the
   contrary, this blood money has been paid over to that jury. *
   * * Condemned to death! Perhaps you think I do not know what
   for? Or maybe you think the people do not understand your
   motives? You are mistaken. I am here, standing in this spot
   awaiting your sentence, because I hate and loathe authority in
   every form. I am doomed by you to suffer an ignominious death
   because I am the outspoken enemy of coercion, of privilege, of
   force, of authority. It is for this you make me suffer. Think
   you the people are blind, are asleep, are indifferent? You
   deceive yourselves. I tell you, as a man of the people, and I
   speak for them, that your every word and act and thoughts are
   recorded. You are being weighed in the balance. The people
   are conscious of your power&mdash;your stolen power. They
   know you; that while you masquerade as their servants you are
   in reality playing the role of master. The people&mdash;the
   common working people&mdash;know full well that all your
   wealth, your ease and splendor, have been stolen from them
   by the exercise of your authority in the guise of law and
   order. I, a working man, stand here and to your face, in your
   stronghold of oppression, and denounce to you your crimes
   against humanity. It is for this I die, but my death will not
   have been in vain. I guess I have finished. I don&rsquo;t know as I
   have anything more to say.

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">Pg&nbsp;178</a></span>

   Your Honor knows all I know about this case. I have taken your
   Honor&rsquo;s time up that I might be able to lay this thing, the
   whole thing, before you, reserving nothing; opening my mind
   and heart, telling you the truth, the truth, and the whole
   truth. I am innocent of this offense. I had no connection
   with that Haymarket tragedy. I know nothing of it. I am not
   responsible for it. I leave the case in the hands of your
   Honor.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>SENTENCE PRONOUNCED.</h3>

<p>Parsons spoke altogether nearly nine hours, and the addresses
of all the prisoners occupied three days. Thousands of
people were turned away during the closing days, and
the scene in the courtroom when sentence was pronounced
was peculiarly impressive. At the close of Parsons&rsquo; remarks
Judge Gary delivered the following remarks, and pronounced
the death sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;I am quite well aware that what you have said, although addressed
   to me, has been said to the world; yet nothing has been said which
   weakens the force of the proof or the conclusions therefrom upon which
   the verdict is based. You are all men of intelligence, and know that
   if the verdict stands, it must be executed. The reasons why it shall
   stand I have already sufficiently stated in deciding the motion for a
   new trial. I am sorry beyond any power of expression for your unhappy
   condition and for the terrible events that have brought it about. I
   shall address to you neither reproaches nor exhortation. What I shall
   say, shall be said in the faint hope that a few words from a place
   where the people of the State of Illinois have delegated the authority
   to declare the penalty of a violation of their laws, and spoken upon an
   occasion solemn and awful as this, may

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">Pg&nbsp;179</a></span>

   come to the knowledge of and be heeded by the ignorant, deluded and
   misguided men who have listened to your counsels and followed your
   advice. I say in the faint hope; for if men are persuaded that because
   of business differences, whether about labor or anything else, they may
   destroy property and assault and beat other men, and kill the police,
   if they, in the discharge of their duty, interfere to preserve the
   peace, there is little ground to hope that they will listen to any
   warning. It is not the least among the hardships of the peaceable,
   frugal and laborious poor to endure the tyranny of mobs, who, with
   lawless force, dictate to them, under penalty of peril to limb and
   life, where, when and upon what terms they may earn a livelihood for
   themselves and their families. Any government that is worthy of the
   name will strenuously endeavor to secure to all within its jurisdiction
   freedom to follow the lawful avocations and safety for their property
   and their persons, while obeying the law, and the law is common sense.
   It holds each man responsible for the natural and probable consequences
   of his own acts. It holds that whoever advises murder is himself guilty
   of the murder that is committed pursuant to his advice, and if men band
   together for a forcible resistance to the execution of the law and
   advise murder as a means of making such resistance effectual, whether
   such advice be to one man to murder another, or to a numerous class to
   murder men of another class, all who are so banded together are guilty
   of any murder that is committed in pursuance of such advice. The people
   of this country love their institutions, they love their homes, they
   love their property. They will never consent, that by violence and
   murder, those institutions shall be broken down, their homes despoiled,
   and their property destroyed. And the people are

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">Pg&nbsp;180</a></span>

   strong enough to protect and sustain their institutions and to punish
   all offenders against their laws; and those who threaten danger to
   civil society, if the law is enforced, are leading to destruction
   whoever may attempt to execute such threats. The existing order of
   society can be changed only by the will of the majority. Each man has
   the full right to entertain and advocate by speech and print such
   opinions as suits himself, and the great body of the people will
   usually care little what he says. But if he proposes murder as a means
   of enforcing he puts his own life at stake. And no clamor about free
   speech or the evils to be cured or the wrongs to be redressed, will
   shield him from the consequences of his crime. His liberty is not a
   license to destroy. The toleration that he enjoys he must extend to
   others, and not arrogantly assume that the great majority are wrong and
   may rightfully be coerced by terror, or removed by dynamite. It only
   remains that for the crime you have committed, and of which you have
   been convicted after a trial unexampled in the patience with which an
   outraged people have extended to you every protection and privilege of
   the law which you derided and defied, that the sentence of that law
   be now given. In form and detail that sentence will appear upon the
   records of the Court. In substance and effect it is that the defendant
   Neebe be imprisoned in the State Penitentiary at Joliet at hard labor
   for the term of fifteen years. And that each of the other defendants,
   between the hours of ten o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon and two o&rsquo;clock in the
   afternoon of the third day of December next, in the manner provided by
   the statute of this state, be hung by the neck until he is dead. Remove
   the prisoners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Stay of sentence in the case of Neebe was granted until December
3, the date set for the execution of the other principles;
and the counsel for the condemned Anarchists announced that
they should file a bill of exceptions before the Illinois Supreme
Court, and petition for a supersedeas.</p>

</div>

<p>As the trial progressed many new and sensational developments
were made. Dr. Ernst Schmidt was constituted chairman
of the committee of an organization, taking charge of matters
pertaining to raising money for the defense. F. Bielefeld became
business manager of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>. In all the important
cities meetings were held in the interests of the condemned
men. Mrs. Lucy Parsons, wife of the condemned
anarchist, went on a lecturing tour to replenish the exchequer
of the defendants, but public opinion in many places was against
her, and she found it difficult in many places to obtain halls in
which to speak. At Akron, Ohio, she was arrested for holding
a meeting in defiance of the order of the mayor of that city.
She has for years been an active anarchistic agitator, and her
proclivities for public speech-making has brought her often before
the public. She was arrested September 23 for a violation
of the ordinance prohibiting the distribution of circulars on the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">Pg&nbsp;182</a></span>

street of Chicago. In New York, Herr Most, through his paper, the
<cite>Freiheit</cite>, indorsed the
bomb-throwing, saying: &ldquo;Its work was thorough. Such bombs can
be made by anybody, without much trouble, of an evening. Think of
500 revolutionists provided, say, each with six of these things,
working in concert, so that, for example, in the wide range of a great
cosmopolitan city within half an hour the fragments were to go flying
in various suitable places, who will gainsay that by this means such a
panic could be created that a comparatively small number of determined
men might get possession of all commanding points in the place in a
giffy? Nobody. The bomb in Chicago was legally justified, and, in a
military sense, excellent. All honor to him who produced and made use
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For this, and similar incendiary utterances, Most was arrested
and sentenced to serve a year in Sing Sing prison. He was living
with Lena Fischer, alias Mary Georges, at 198 Allen street, under
the name of West, and when captured was found in hiding under
the woman&rsquo;s bed. The woman was thought to be a sister of
<del>Adolf</del><ins>Adolph</ins> Fischer, one of the condemned Chicago
anarchists, but this was denied.</p>

<h3>MISS <del>NINA</del><ins>NI&Ntilde;A</ins> VAN ZANDT,</h3>

<p>who has constituted herself the heroine of Anarchistic notoriety
by developing a tender passion for the notorious Spies, is a young
lady of eighteen years of age, with a fine form and a fair share
of personal attractions; neither a pronounced blonde, nor yet a
brunette, but seemingly occupying the middle ground, between.
<del>Nina</del><ins>Ni&ntilde;a</ins> is the daughter of the
<del>superintendant</del><ins>superintendent</ins> of the great
Kirk soap factory of Chicago, and the heiress apparent to quite a
fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">Pg&nbsp;183</a></span></p>

<p>She is of a dashing romantic disposition; fond of flowers, birds
and dogs. She fell a victim to the ardent glances of the humorous
editor as the sequence of having made his acquaintance while inserting
an advertisement in the <cite>Zeitung</cite> to recover her lost
pug, to whom she was much attached. Through the efforts of Spies she
recovered her pet canine, and while performing the duty of expressing
her gratitude to the editor she was smitten, and yielded passively to
her fate. She became so infatuated in her attachment and attentions
to Spies that in February, 1887, a marriage license was procured for
the purpose of becoming his wife in the jail, but the sheriff forbade
the ceremony as illegal and unprecedented. It was then determined that
the ceremony should take place by proxy. Spies&rsquo; brother became
the proxy, and the ceremony took place before Justice Englehardt
in the town of Jefferson. Justice Englehardt made returns of the
marriage to the county clerk, who refused to recognize the return,
pronouncing the ceremony illegal. This wife, in name only, was placed
on exhibition in wax in one of the dime museums, when the cheeky
manager was served with an injunction; but this young would-be wife
compromised the matter, it is thought, on condition that part of the
<del>emmoluments</del><ins>emoluments</ins> went into a fund for the
benefit of her condemned lord.</p>

<h3>MRS. OSCAR NEEBE</h3>

<p>died quite suddenly in March, 1887. Neebe, under guard of
Jailor Folz, visited the bedside of his
dying wife and by official clemency remained some time with his
children, and everything was done for the condemned men that could be
done in the name of humanity under the circumstances.</p>

<h3>THE SUPERSEDEAS GRANTED.</h3>

<p>There was no doubt from the beginning that the supersedeas
asked for in behalf of the condemned anarchists would be
granted. Capt. W. P. Black and Hon. Leonard Swett, who had
been retained to present the petition and make the argument for
a new trial, met Chief Justice Scott at Bloomington by appointment,
Nov. 25, 1886, and he directed the writ of error to issue.
The only thing of substance which Justice Scott said at the
entering of the order was to call attention to the following language
in Mooney vs. The People, CXI. Illinois, page 388&mdash;an
opinion by the full court:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>Recognizing to the fullest extent the rule of law that the
   jury in their deliberations are judges of the facts and the
   weight of the evidence in criminal cases, yet the law has
   imposed on the court the solemn and responsible duty to see
   to it that no injustice is done by hasty action, passion, or
   prejudice, or from any other cause on the part of the jury.
   This duty the court may not omit in any case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">Pg&nbsp;185</a></span></p>

<p>It is almost needless to state that the anarchists were well
pleased with their temporary reprieve, and opportunity to have
their able counsel argue for a rehearing of their case. The
arguments were finished March 18, 1887, before the Supreme
Court at Ottawa, States Attorney Grinnell and Attorney General
Hunt appearing for the State. The decision was rendered
Wednesday, September 14, before the full bench of Supreme
justices, being read by Judge Magruder, of Chicago. It will
thus be seen that the Supreme Court gave the questions at issue
full and ample consideration during a period of nearly six
months. The courtroom was crowded by an expectant throng,
and the announcement of the decision was foreshadowed by
impressive solemnity. In a condensed review like this it would
be manifestly impossible to give a decision comprising upwards
of 60,000 words, and covering every point and detail of the
case. It is sufficient to state that the decision was unanimous
on the part of the justices. Even Justice Mulkey, who was
thought to lean toward a new trial, declared that, after having
fully examined the record and given the questions arising on it
his very best thought, with an earnest and conscientious desire
to faithfully discharge his whole duty, he was fully satisfied that
the opinion reached vindicates the law and does complete justice
between the people and the defendants, fully warranted by
the law and evidence.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Sheldon made the following announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;In this case the court orders that the sentence of the
   Criminal Court of Cook county on the defendants in the
   indictment of August Spies, Michael Schwab, Samuel Fielden,
   Albert R. Parsons, Adolph Fischer, George Engel, and Louis
   Lingg, be carried into effect by the sheriff of Cook county on
   Friday, November

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">Pg&nbsp;186</a></span>

   11 next, between the hours of 10 o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon and 4
   o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon of that day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The formal order for the execution of the anarchists was
received by Sheriff Matson, of Cook county, Monday, September
26. The guards inside and patrol outside the jail had been
doubled upon receipt of the news that the Supreme Court had
sustained the verdict. Monday night Oscar Neebe was quietly
removed from the jail in a carriage and taken to Joliet by train
by Deputy Sheriffs Gleason and Spear, Neebe being handcuffed
securely to the latter officer. Neebe&rsquo;s companions and
outside sympathizers did not know of his removal. Neebe said
to a reporter of the <cite>News</cite> that he had abandoned all hope. He
said he would rather step upon the gallows with his companions
than to go to prison; related what he had accomplished for
employees of Chicago breweries and the grocery clerks, in getting
their hours shortened; was unrepentant of his part in the
conspiracy, and said: &ldquo;What I have done I would do again,
and the time will come when the blood of the martyrs about to
be sacrificed will cry aloud for vengeance, and that cry will be
heard, aye, and that, too, before many years elapse.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>EFFORTS TO SAVE THE ANARCHISTS HAD FAILED.</h3>

<p>Upon receipt of the news of the affirmation of the sentence
by the Supreme Court, A. R. Parsons sent to the newspapers an
appeal, &ldquo;To the American People,&rdquo; in which he maintained his
innocence; declared that his speeches were lawful; condemned
the evidence of detectives; refused executive clemency, concluding
in the words of Patrick Henry, &ldquo;I know not what course
others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me
death.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">Pg&nbsp;187</a></span></p>

<p>A. R. Parsons&rsquo;s open letter to the American people in which
he justifies his actions, maintains his innocence, and refuses
executive clemency, ran as follows, under date of September 22,
1887:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE&mdash;<em>Fellow Citizens</em>:
   As all the world knows, I have been convicted and
   sentenced to die for the crime of murder, the most heinous
   offense that can be committed. Under the form of law two
   courts&mdash;viz: the Criminal and Supreme courts of the State
   of Illinois&mdash;have sentenced me to death as an accessory
   before the fact to the murder of Officer Degan on May 4, 1886.
   Nevertheless, I am innocent of the crime charged, and to a
   candid and unprejudiced world I submit the proof:</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>PARSONS MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCE.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;In the decision affirming the sentence of death upon
   me the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois says: &lsquo;It is
   undisputed that the bomb was thrown that caused the death of
   Degan. It is conceded that no one of the defendants threw
   the bomb with his own hands. Plaintiffs in error are charged
   with being accessories before the fact.&rsquo; If I did not throw
   the bomb myself it becomes necessary to prove that I aided,
   encouraged, and advised the person who did throw it. Is that
   fact proved? The Supreme Court says it is. The record says
   it is not. I appeal to the American people to judge between
   them.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The Supreme Court quotes articles from the
   <cite>Alarm</cite>, the paper edited by me, and from my
   speeches running back three years before the Haymarket tragedy
   of May 4, 1886. Upon said articles and speeches the court
   affirms my sentence of death as an accessory. The court says,
   &lsquo;The articles in the <cite>Alarm</cite>

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">Pg&nbsp;188</a></span>

   were most of them written by the defendant Parsons, and some
   of them by the defendant Spies,&rsquo; and then proceeds to quote
   these articles. I refer to the record to prove that of all the
   articles quoted only one was shown to have been written by me.
   I wrote, of course, a great many articles for my paper, the
   <cite>Alarm</cite>, but the record will show that only one
   of these many quoted by the Supreme Court to prove my guilt
   as an accessory was written by me. This article appeared in
   the <cite>Alarm</cite> December 6, 1884, one year and a half
   before the Haymarket meeting. As to Mr. Spies, the record
   will show that during the three years I was editor of the
   <cite>Alarm</cite> he did not write for the paper half a dozen
   articles. For proof as to this I appeal to the record.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The <cite>Alarm</cite> was a labor paper, and, as is
   well known, a labor paper is conducted as a medium through
   which working people can make known their grievances. The
   <cite>Alarm</cite> was no exception to this rule. I not only
   did not write &lsquo;most of the articles,&rsquo; but wrote comparatively
   few of them. This the record will also show.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;In referring to my Haymarket speech the court says: &lsquo;To
   the men then listening to him he had addressed the incendiary
   appeals that had been appearing in the <cite>Alarm</cite>
   for two years. The court then quotes the incendiary article
   which I did write, and which is as follows: &lsquo;One dynamite bomb
   properly placed will destroy a regiment of soldiers, a weapon
   easily made, and carried with perfect safety in the pockets of
   one&rsquo;s clothing.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>SIMPLY A QUOTATION FROM GENERAL SHERIDAN.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">Pg&nbsp;189</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;The record will show by referring to the
   <cite>Alarm</cite> that this is a garbled extract taken
   from a statement made by Gen. Philip Sheridan in his annual
   report to Congress. It was simply a reiteration of General
   Sheridan&rsquo;s statement that dynamite was easily made, perfectly
   safe to handle, and a very destructive weapon of warfare. The
   article in full as it appeared in the <cite>Alarm</cite> is as
   follows: &lsquo;Dynamite&mdash;The protection of the poor against
   the armies of the rich&mdash;in submitting his annual report,
   November 10, 1884, Gen. Philip Sheridan, commander of the
   United States army, says: &ldquo;This nation is growing so rapidly
   that there are signs of other troubles, which I hope will
   not occur and which will probably not come upon us if both
   capital and labor will only be conservative. Still, it should
   be remembered, destructive explosives are easily made, and
   that banks, United States sub-treasuries, and large mercantile
   houses can be readily demolished and the commerce of entire
   cities destroyed by an infuriated people with means carried
   with perfect safety to themselves in the pockets of their
   clothing.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The editorial comment upon the above as it appeared in
   the <cite>Alarm</cite> is as follows: &lsquo;A hint to the wise
   is sufficient&rsquo;. Of course General Sheridan is too modest
   to tell us that himself and army will be powerless in the
   coming revolution between the propertied and the propertyless
   classes. Only in foreign wars can the usual weapons of warfare
   be used to any advantage. One dynamite bomb properly placed
   will destroy a regiment of soldiers; a weapon easily made and
   carried with perfect safety in the pockets of one&rsquo;s clothing.
   The First regiment may as well disband, for if it should ever
   level its guns upon the working men of Chicago it can be
   totally annihilated.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Again the court says: &lsquo;He (Parsons) had said to them
   (referring to the people assembled at the Haymarket)
   Saturday,

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">Pg&nbsp;190</a></span>

   April 24, 1886, just
   ten days before May 4, in the <cite>Alarm</cite> that had
   appeared: &ldquo;Working men, to arms! War to the palace, peace to
   the cottage, and death to luxurious idleness! The wage system
   is the only cause of the world&rsquo;s misery. It is supported by
   the rich classes, and to destroy it they must be either made
   work or die. One pound of dynamite is better than a bushel
   of ballots! Make your demand for eight hours with weapons in
   your hands to meet the capitalist bloodhounds&mdash;police and
   militia&mdash;in the proper manner.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The record will show that this article was not written
   by me, but was published as a news item. By referring to
   the columns of the <cite>Alarm</cite> the following comment
   appears, attached to the above article, viz: &lsquo;The above hand
   bill was sent to us from Indianapolis, Ind., having been
   posted all over that city last week. Our correspondent says
   that the police tore them down wherever they found them.&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The court continuing, says: &lsquo;At the close of another
   article in the same issue he said: &ldquo;The social war has come,
   and whoever is not with us is against us.&ldquo;&rsquo; Assistant State&rsquo;s
   Attorney Walker read this article to the jury, and at its
   conclusion stated that it bore my initials and was my article.
   It is a matter within the knowledge of every one present that
   I interrupted him and called his attention to the fact that
   the article did not bear my initials, and that I was not its
   author. Mr. Walker corrected his mistake to the jury.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Now these are the three articles quoted by the Supreme
   Court as proof of my guilt as an accessory in a conspiracy
   to murder Officer Degan. The record will prove what I
   say.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>HIS SPEECHES WERE ALL RIGHT.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">Pg&nbsp;191</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Now as to my speeches&mdash;all of them, with one
   exception purporting to be my utterances at the Haymarket, are
   given from the excited imaginations and <del>preverted</del>
   <ins>perverted</ins> memories of newspaper reporters. Mr.
   English, who alone took shorthand notes and swore to their
   correctness, reports me as saying. &lsquo;It is time to raise
   a note of warning. There is nothing in the eight-hour movement
   to excite the capitalist. Don&rsquo;t you know that the militia
   are under arms and a <del>gatling</del><ins>Gatling</ins> gun
   is ready to mow you down? Was this Germany, or Russia, or
   Spain? [A voice: &ldquo;It looks like it.&rdquo;] Whenever
   you make a demand for eight hours&rsquo; pay or increase of
   pay the militia and the deputy sheriffs and the Pinkerton
   men are called out and you are shot and clubbed and murdered
   in the streets. I am not here for the purpose of exciting
   anybody, but to speak out, to tell the facts as they exist
   even though it shall cost me my life before morning!&rsquo;
   Mr. English continuing, said: &lsquo;There is another part
   of it (the speech) right here. It behooves you, as you love
   your wife and children, if you don&rsquo;t want to see them
   perish with hunger, killed, or cut down like dogs on the
   street&mdash;Americans, in the interest of your liberty and
   your independence, to arms; arm yourselves!&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;This, be it remembered, is a garbled extract, and it
   is a matter of record that Reporter English testified that
   he was instructed by the proprietor of his paper to report
   only the inflammatory portions of the speeches made at the
   meeting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>THE MAYOR HEARD THE SPEECH.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Mayor Harrison, who was present and heard this speech,
   testified before the jury that it was simply &lsquo;a violent and
   political harangue&rsquo; and did not call for his interference as
   a peace officer. The speech delivered by me at the Haymarket,
   and which I

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">Pg&nbsp;192</a></span>

   repeated before the jury is a matter of record and undisputed,
   and I challenge any one to show therein that I incited any
   one to acts of violence. The extract reported by Mr. English,
   when taken in connection with what preceded and what followed,
   cannot be construed by the wildest imagination as incitement to
   violence. Extracts from three other speeches alleged to have
   been delivered by me were made more than one year prior to May
   4, 1886, are given. Two of these speeches were reported from
   the memory of the Pinkerton detective Johnson. These are the
   speeches quoted by the court as proof of my guilt as accessory
   to the murder of Degan. Where, then, is the connection between
   these speeches and the murder of Degan? I am bold to declare
   that such connection is imperceptible to the eye of a fair
   and unprejudiced mind. But the honorable body, the Supreme
   Court of Illinois, has condemned me to death for speeches I
   never made, and for articles I never wrote. In the affirmation
   of the death sentence the court has &lsquo;assumed,&rsquo;
   &rsquo;supposed,&rsquo; &lsquo;guessed,&rsquo;
   &rsquo;surmised,&rsquo; and &lsquo;presumed&rsquo; that I
   can and did &rsquo;so and so.&rsquo; This the record fully
   proves.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The court says: &lsquo;Spies, Schwab, Parsons and Engel were
   responsible for the articles written and published by them, as
   above shown; Spies, Schwab, Fielden, Parsons and Engel were
   responsible for the speeches made by them respectively, and
   there is evidence in the same record tending to show that the
   death of Degan occurred during the prosecution of a conspiracy
   planned by the members of the international groups who read
   these articles and heard these speeches.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>OBJECTS TO THE PINKERTON MEN.</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">Pg&nbsp;193</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Now, I defy any one to show from the record the proof that
   I wrote more than one of the many articles alleged to have
   been written by me. Yet the Supreme Court says that I wrote
   and am responsible for all of them. Again&mdash;concerning the
   alleged speeches&mdash;they were reported by the Pinkerton
   detective Johnson, who was, as the record shows, employed by
   Lyman Gage, president of the First National Bank, as the agent
   of the Citizens&rsquo; Association, an organization composed of the
   millionaire employers of Chicago.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I submit to a candid world if this hired spy would not
   make false reports to earn blood-money. Thus, it is for
   speeches I did not make, and articles I did not write I am
   sentenced to die, because the court &lsquo;assumes&rsquo; that these
   articles influenced some unknown and still unidentified person
   to throw the bomb that killed Degan. Is this law? Is this
   justice?</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The Supreme Court, in affirming the sentence of death
   upon me, proceeds to give further reasons, as follows: &lsquo;Two
   circumstances are to be noted. First, it can hardly be said
   that Parsons was absent from the Haymarket meeting when he
   went to Zepf&rsquo;s Hall. It has already been stated that the
   latter place was only a few steps north of the speakers&rsquo; wagon
   and in sight from it. We do not think that the defendant
   Parsons could escape his share of the responsibility for
   the explosions at the Haymarket because he stepped into a
   neighboring saloon and looked at the explosion through a
   window. While he was speaking men stood around him with arms
   in their hands. Many of these were members of the armed
   sections of the international groups. Among them were men who
   belonged to the International Rifles, an armed organization in
   which he himself was an officer, and with which he had been
   drilling in preparation for the events then transpiring.&rsquo;</p>

   <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">Pg&nbsp;194</a></span></p>

   <p>&ldquo;The records of the trial will show that not one of the
   foregoing allegations is true. The facts are these: Zepf&rsquo;s
   Hall is on the northeast corner of Lake and Desplaines
   streets, just one block north of the speakers&rsquo; wagon. The
   court says &lsquo;it was only a few steps north of the speakers&rsquo;
   wagon.&rsquo; The court says further that &lsquo;it can hardly be said
   that Parsons was absent from the Haymarket meeting when he
   was at Zepf&rsquo;s Hall.&rsquo; If this is correct logic, then I was at
   two different places a block apart at the same instant. Truly
   the day of miracles has not yet passed. Again, the record
   will show that I did not &rsquo;step into a neighboring saloon and
   look at the explosion through a window.&rsquo; It will show that
   I went to Zepf&rsquo;s Hall, one block distant, and across Lake
   street, accompanied by my wife and another lady, and my two
   children (a girl of five and a boy of seven years of age),
   they having sat upon a wagon about ten feet from the speakers&rsquo;
   wagon throughout my speech; that it looked like rain; that we
   had started home and went into Zepf&rsquo;s Hall to wait for the
   meeting to adjourn, and walked home in company with a lot of
   friends who lived in that direction. Zepf&rsquo;s building is on
   the corner and opens on the street with a triangular door six
   feet wide. Myself and ladies and children were just inside the
   door. Here, while waiting for our friends and looking toward
   the meeting, I had a fair view of the explosion. All this the
   record will show.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE BOMB.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;It would seem that, according to circumstances, a
   block is at one time &lsquo;a few steps&rsquo; or a &lsquo;few
   steps&rsquo; is more than a block, as the case may suit. The
   logical as well as the imaginative faculties of the Supreme
   Court are further illustrated in a

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">Pg&nbsp;195</a></span>

   most striking manner by the credence of the court to the
   &lsquo;yarn&rsquo; of a &lsquo;reporter,&rsquo; who testified that Spies had described
   to him the &lsquo;Czar&rsquo; bomb, and the men who were to use them as
   follows. &lsquo;He spoke of a body of tall, strong men in their
   organization who could throw bombs weighing five pounds 150
   paces. He stated that the bombs in question were to be used in
   case of conflict with the police or the militia.&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The court gives this sort of testimony as proof of
   the existence of a conspiracy to murder Degan. Wonderful
   credulity. To throw a five-pound bomb 150 paces or yards is to
   throw it 450 feet or a quarter of a mile.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Gulliver, in his travels among the Brobdingnag race, tells
   us of the giants he met, and we have also heard of the giants
   of Patagonia. But we did not know until now that they were
   mere Lilliputians as compared with the &lsquo;anarchist Swedes&rsquo; of
   Chicago.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The court proceeds to say, &lsquo;While he (Parsons) was
   speaking, men stood around him with arms in their hands.&rsquo;
   The record as quoted by the court shows that only one man
   flourished a pistol, not a number of men. Again, the court
   says, &lsquo;Most of the men were members of the armed sections of
   the &ldquo;International groups,&rdquo;&rsquo; thus making it appear that many
   of these men (when there was only one who was even alleged to
   have exhibited a pistol) were armed.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The court says: &lsquo;Among them were men who belonged to the
   &ldquo;International Rifles,&rdquo; an armed organization in which he
   himself was an officer, and in which he had been drilling in
   preparation for the events then transpiring.&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Now I <del>C</del><ins>c</ins>hallenge the Supreme
   Court or any other honorable gentleman to prove from the record
   that there ever existed

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">Pg&nbsp;196</a></span>

   such an organization as the armed section of the American
   group, known as the &lsquo;International Rifles.&rsquo; It cannot be done.
   The record shows that some members of the American group did
   organize the &lsquo;International Rifles,&rsquo; which never met but
   four or five times; was never armed with rifles or any other
   weapons, and was disbanded nearly a year before the 4th of
   May, 1886.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;The Pinkerton man Johnson says that dynamite
   bombs were exhibited &lsquo;in the presence of the
   &ldquo;International Rifles.&rdquo;&rsquo; It will take
   corroborative testimony before the American people will credit
   the statements of such a man engaged for such a purpose; and
   it is well known that Supreme courts have decided that the
   testimony of detectives should be taken with great caution.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>HE APPEALS TO THE PEOPLE.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;I appeal to the American people, to their love of
   justice and fair play. I submit that the record does not show
   my <del>gilt</del><ins>guilt</ins> of the crime of murder, but
   on the contrary it proves my innocence.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Against me in this trial all the rules of law and evidence
   have been reversed in that I have been held as guilty until I
   proved my innocence. I have been tried ostensibly for murder,
   but in reality for anarchy. I have been proved guilty of being
   an anarchist and condemned to die for that reason. The State&rsquo;s
   attorney said in his statement before the court and jury in
   the beginning of the trial: &lsquo;These defendants were picked out
   and indicted by the grand jury. They are no more guilty than
   the thousands who follow them. They are picked out because
   they are leaders. Convict them and our society is safe,&rsquo;
   and in their last appeal to the jury the prosecution said:
   &lsquo;Anarchy is on

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">Pg&nbsp;197</a></span>

   trial. Hang these eight men and save our institutions. These
   are the leaders. Make examples of them.&rsquo; This is a matter of
   record.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>A WORD FOR HIS COMRADES.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;So far as I have had time to examine the records I find
   the same fabrication and perversion of testimony against all
   my comrades as exists against myself. I therefore again appeal
   to to the American people to avert the crime of judicial
   murder. And this appeal I have faith will not be in vain.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;My ancestors partook of all the hardships incident to the
   establishment of this Republic. They fought, bled, and some
   of them died that the Declaration of Independence might live
   and the American flag might wave in triumph over those who
   claim the &lsquo;divine right of kings to rule.&rsquo; Shall the flag now,
   after a century&rsquo;s triumph, trail in the mire of oppression
   and protect the perpetration of outrages and oppressions that
   would put the older despotisms of Europe to shame?</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Knowing myself innocent of crime I came forward and gave
   myself up for trial. I felt that it was my duty to take my
   chances with the rest of my comrades. I sought a fair and
   impartial trial before a jury of my peers, and knew that
   before any fair-minded jury I could with little difficulty be
   cleared. I preferred to be tried and take the chances of an
   acquittal with my friends to being hunted as a felon. Have I
   had a fair trial?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>PARSONS REFUSES EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;The lovers of justice and fair play are assiduously
   engaged in an effort to thwart the consummation of judicial
   murder by

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">Pg&nbsp;198</a></span>

   a commutation of sentence to prison. I speak for myself alone
   when I say that for this I thank them and appreciate their
   efforts. But I am an innocent man. I have violated no law;
   I have committed no offense against any one&rsquo;s rights. I am
   simply the victim of the malice of those whose anger has been
   aroused by the growth, strength and independence of the labor
   organizations of America. I am a sacrifice to those who say:
   &lsquo;These men may be innocent. No matter. They are anarchists. We
   must hang them anyway.&rsquo;</p>

   <p>&ldquo;My counsel informs me that every effort will be made to
   take this case before the highest tribunal in the land, and
   that there is strong hope of a hearing there. But I am also
   reliably informed that from three to five years will elapse
   before the Supreme Court of the United States can hear and
   adjudge the case.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Since surrendering myself to the authorities, I have been
   locked up in close confinement twenty-one hours out of every
   twenty-four for six days, and from Saturday afternoon till
   Monday morning (thirty-eight hours) each week in a noisome
   cell, without a ray of sunlight or a breath of pure air. To
   be compelled to bear this for five or even three years would
   be to suffer a lingering death, and it is only a matter of
   serious consideration with me whether I ought to accept the
   verdict as it stands rather than die by inches under such
   conditions. I am prepared to die. I am ready, if needs be, to
   lay down my life for my rights and the rights of my fellow
   men. But I object to being killed on false and unproved
   accusations. Therefore I cannot countenance or accept the
   efforts of those who would endeavor to procure a commutation
   of my sentence to an imprisonment in the penitentiary. Neither
   do I approve of any

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">Pg&nbsp;199</a></span>

   further appeals to the courts of law. I believe them to be all
   alike&mdash;agency of the privileged classes to perpetuate
   their power, to oppress and plunder the toiling masses. As
   between capital and its legal rights, and labor and its legal
   rights, the courts of law must side with the capitalistic
   class. To appeal to them is in vain. It is the appeal of the
   wage slave to his capitalistic master for liberty. The answer
   is curses, blows, imprisonment, and death.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;If I had never been an anarchist before, my experience
   with courts and the laws of the governing class would make an
   anarchist of me now. What is anarchy? It is a state of society
   without any central or governing power. Upon this subject the
   court, in its affirmation of the death sentence, defines the
   object of the International Working Peoples&rsquo; Association as
   follows:</p>

   <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is designed to bring about a social revolution. Social
   revolution means the destruction of the right of private
   ownership of property, or of the right of the individual to
   own property. It means of the bringing about of a state of
   society in which all property should be held in common.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>HE REFERS TO THE SCRIPTURES.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;If this definition is right, then it is very similar to
   that advocated by Jesus Christ, for proof of which I refer to
   the fourth and fifth chapters of the Acts of the Apostles;
   also Matthew xxi., 10 to 14, and Mark xi., 15 to 19.</p>

    <p>&ldquo;No, I am not guilty. I have not been proved guilty.
    I leave it to you to decide from the record itself as to my
    guilt or innocence. I cannot, therefore, accept a commutation
    to imprisonment. I appeal&mdash;not for mercy, but for
    justice. As for me, the utterance of Patrick Henry is so
    <del>appropos</del><ins>appropos</ins> that I cannot do better
    than let him speak:</p>

   <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">Pg&nbsp;200</a></span></p>

   <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Is life so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at
   the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I
   know not what course others may take, but, as for me, give me
   liberty or give me death.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="quotsig">A. R. PARSONS,<br />
&ldquo;Prison Cell 29, Chicago, Ill., Sept. 21, 1887.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE CASE BEFORE THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT.</h3>

<p>The anarchists were not lacking in funds to secure every
chance of reprieve or commutation, as contributions had poured
into their coffers swelling the sum total over $50,000. Every
opportunity was accorded to the condemned men to place their
case in as favorable a light as possible before the Federal Court.
But the flagrant and far-reaching character of their crime gave
little hope to the unbiased that the judges composing that honorable
body would interfere. Following our readers will find
Attorney Grinnell&rsquo;s argument before the United States Supreme
Court. Also General Butler&rsquo;s defense for the impenitent yet
doomed men.</p>

<h3>GRINNELL&rsquo;S ARGUMENT BEFORE THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.</h3>

<p>Mr. Grinnell, addressing the court, said that it had not been
his intention to take part in the oral argument, and that he came
here primarily for the purpose of assisting Mr. Hunt by means of his
familiarity with the record in this case. He thought that by the
presentation of the law and the facts yesterday it was clearly shown
that there was no federal question involved, and that the court was
without <del>jurisdidtion</del><ins>jurisdiction</ins> to grant the
writ of error. The assignments of error in the lower court, and the
parts of the record relating to the jurors Denker and Sanford had been
printed and were in the court&rsquo;s hands. In all

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">Pg&nbsp;201</a></span>

the twenty-eight assignments of error there was no reference
directly or indirectly to the constitution of the United States or
any of its amendments. There were some things, he said, which
were here generally conceded, and one of them was that the
constitution itself confers no rights which need be here considered.
It is simply a limitation of the rights of the legislative
power in dealing with the rights of citizens.</p>

<h3>THE QUESTION OF JURISDICTION.</h3>

<p>The constitution of the State of Illinois contains almost all
the provisions which are embraced in the constitution of the
United States. This court had settled, he believed, the question
of jurisdiction as far as the first ten amendments are concerned,
and also, he thought, under the fourteenth amendment. The
only clause of the latter which could figure here was that &ldquo;no
State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without
due process of law.&rdquo; Whatever affects liberty and life is
made by this clause to affect also property. If the court has
jurisdiction of this case under this provision of the amendment
then every State question relating to property, such as special
assessments, the condemnation of property, etc., might be
brought to this court for review.</p>

<p>The Chief Justice&mdash;&ldquo;Because they take property without
valuation by a jury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, your honor, in some cases they do,
especially in the matter of drainage, where the proceedings may
be before a justice of the peace.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES.</h3>

<p>Mr. Grinnell said he thought it to be conceded that a State

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">Pg&nbsp;202</a></span>

Legislature had a right to prescribe how many peremptory challenges
should be allowed in the formation of a jury. The common law of
Illinois had been radically changed in this respect, and both
prosecution and defendant now stood on an equal footing. Each defendant
was entitled to twenty peremptory challenges, and as the eight
defendants in this case acted in concert and were all consulted, each
of them had practically 160 peremptory challenges. The State had a like
number. The defendants exhausted all of their 160 peremptory challenges
before a jury was obtained and the State availed itself of its
<del>priviledge</del><ins>privilege</ins> to the extent of fifty-two
challenges. He maintained, however, that no federal question would be
involved even if the State allowed only one peremptory challenge to one
side and 160 to the other. It was the State&rsquo;s right. In this case
there were 931 men called into the jury box and examined in order to
obtain twelve jurors.</p>

<h3>JURORS SANFORD AND DENKER.</h3>

<p>No objection was raised to any one of the twelve jurors with the
single exception of Sanford. Denker was challenged for cause after
a brief examination; the challenge was overruled and the defense
accepted, but they then proceeded with a further and more elaborate
examination of him, and it is shown by the record that after this
second examination they desired to keep him, that they did keep him,
and that they did make no further exception. When Denker was taken
the defense had left 142 peremptory challenges and they could have
used one of these challenges to get rid of him if they had been
very <del>deirsous</del><ins>desirous</ins> of so doing. They had
forty-three peremptory challenges left after eleven jurors had been
sworn. These forty-three

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">Pg&nbsp;203</a></span>

challenges they frittered away frivolously for the purpose of
taking some possible advantage. Their peremptory challenges
were then exhausted, and they had to either take a juror or
show cause why he should be rejected.</p>

<p>The examination of Sanford, the last juror, clearly demonstrated,
Mr. Grinnell said, that the defense were more ready to
take him than the State was. Not a single juror was put upon
the defense to exhaust their peremptory challenges. Whenever
a man said that he had talked with a witness or any one who
was present at the Haymarket meeting, or that he had attended
the coroner&rsquo;s inquest he was rejected for cause.</p>

<h3>EULOGIZING THE JURY.</h3>

<p>Speaking of the jury as a whole, Mr. Grinnell said: &ldquo;I
wish and am constrained to pay one tribute to that jury. It
exemplified American citizenship in this country more than any
jury that was ever looked upon. It embraced all walks of life.
Three of them earned their living by manual work. They came
from all parts of the country and one of them was born on foreign
soil. They were not a class jury. They were honest
citizens with the solemn duty devolving upon them of determining
what should be done with those men. No judge could
look in the faces of that jury without saying: &lsquo;They are intelligent;
they represent American citizenship; they are fit to be
trusted with the rights of freemen under our constitution.&rsquo;
There was not a capitalist on that jury. They were all common-place
small dealers and intelligent men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell said he would challenge any one to show that
a single member of that jury was not a competent juror, not
only under the jury law of Illinois, but under the common law.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">Pg&nbsp;204</a></span>

&ldquo;Congress,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had recognized the right of States to
make their own jury laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Section 800 of the Revised Statutes provides that &ldquo;jurors
to serve in the courts of the United States in each State respectively
shall have <del>the</del>the same qualifications and be entitled to
the same exemptions as jurors of the highest court of law in
such State may have and be entitled to at the time when such
jurors for service in the courts of the United State are summoned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost every State in the North, he said, now had its new
jury law, and these laws have been sustained by the highest
State courts.</p>

<h3>THE SEIZURE OF SPIES&rsquo; PAPERS.</h3>

<p>Proceeding to the question of &ldquo;unreasonable search and
seizure&rdquo; in Spies&rsquo; office, he said it did not strike him as being
any part of this case. He was not here to offer any apologies
for his own conduct. He then recited at some length the circumstances
of the bomb-throwing in the Haymarket, the search
of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> office, the prying open of Spies&rsquo; desk,
the finding of dynamite and letters there, the breaking open of
Lingg&rsquo;s domicile, and the finding in his trunk of dynamite
bombs precisely like the one thrown. Mr. Grinnell was interrupted
at this point by General Butler, who said he should want
to cross-examine him if it was competent for him to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell&mdash;&ldquo;You shall have that privilege, General.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Grinnell, resuming, said that such seizure was not a
thing which this court could regulate. It had said in the Ker
<del>kidnapping</del><ins>kidnapping case</ins> that it was not for the
court to determine how he (the prisoner) got here. The court simply
said: &ldquo;You are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">Pg&nbsp;205</a></span>

here.&rdquo; The things seized in the search of these prisoners&rsquo; premises
&ldquo;were there,&rdquo; and it was for the court to determine whether
they were legally there. The only question was, &ldquo;Are these
things testimony?&rdquo; and that was not an inquiry for the court.</p>

<h3>SIMPLY EVIDENCE.</h3>

<p>Forgery, murder, and other crimes had to be proved, Mr.
Grinnell said, by such evidence. &ldquo;The pistol found in the
hand of the assassin Guiteau was forcibly taken from him, and
his papers, if I remember rightly, were overhauled. They were
&rsquo;there&rsquo; (that is, in the court), and it was nobody&rsquo;s business
how they got there. That the search and seizure in this case
was an unreasonable search and seizure from the point of view
of the defendants I have no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conclusion Mr. Grinnell said: &ldquo;It strikes us from our
standpoint that the foundation of the constitution is less likely
to be impaired by refusing to grant this writ than by granting
it.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>THE GENERAL&rsquo;S INDIVIDUALITY.</h3>

<p>After a great deal of rambling talk about the composition
of the jury, dissatisfaction with the record, lack of time for
preparation, the sentencing of the prisoners in their absence and
that of their counsel, the injustice done them by &ldquo;unreasonable
search and seizure,&rdquo; etc., General Butler said that if all these
things could be done the question was to be debated whether
this government would not be a little better if it were overturned
into an anarchy than if it were to be carried on in this
fashion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of being misunderstood upon

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">Pg&nbsp;206</a></span>

this question. I have the individuality of being the only man in the
<del>Uuited</del><ins>United States</ins> that condemned and executed
men for undertaking to overturn the law. There were thousands of them.
And for that act, please your honors, a price was set on my head as
though I were a wolf, and $25,000 was offered to any man that could
capture me, to murder me, by Jefferson Davis and his associates, and
who, if they were here at your bar, trying to ascertain whether they
should have an honest and a fair trial for their great crimes, and they
called upon me&mdash;their lives in danger&mdash;I should hold it to be
my duty to stand here and do all that I might to defend them. That is
the chivalry of the law, if I understand it, and if I don&rsquo;t it
is of not much consequence, for I am quite easily and quickly passing
away.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>INHERENT RIGHTS OF CITIZENS</h3>

<p>After some further talk General Butler said he agreed fully that
the first ten amendments to the constitution were limitations of
federal power and not restrictions of the rights of the States. The
&ldquo;privileges and immunities&rdquo; however, claimed by these
prisoners were privileges inherent in each one of the citizens of
the several States of the United States, because in vast majority
we were British subjects and had certain privileges and immunities
inherited under the common law and <del>m</del><ins>M</ins>agna
<del>c</del><ins>C</ins>harta, and among them, and the most thoroughly
known and defined were the trial by jury for all high crimes,
exemption from search and seizure without warrant of law, protection
from self-accusation when a witness, and not to be deprived of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law. We claim that all the
rights, privileges, and immunities that belonged to a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">Pg&nbsp;207</a></span>

British subject under <del>m</del><ins>M</ins>agna
<del>c</del><ins>C</ins>harta belong to each citizen of the
United States; and that as new citizens of the United States were
made, not citizens of States, by naturalization, these rights,
<del>priviliges</del><ins>privileges</ins>, and immunities came to
them as citizens of the United States. The effect of the fourteenth
amendment was to guarantee these rights, privileges, and immunities to
the citizens of all the States.</p>

<h3>MEANING OF &ldquo;DUE PROCESS OF LAW.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The words &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo; as contained in the fourteenth
amendment, and as used to define one of these guaranteed
rights, mean &ldquo;by the law of the land,&rdquo; not the law of a
county, a province, or a State, but the law of the country&mdash;the
whole country. That is the law of the land, and was so understood
by our forefathers as due process of law. Any other
meaning given to &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo; as it is used in the fourteenth
amendment would make it simply ridiculous and frivolous,
because any State may enact a &ldquo;due process of law&rdquo; according
to that State, by which a man&rsquo;s life may be taken and from
which not a single right or immunity of citizenship can protect
him. Any law a State may make after the passage of this
amendment for dealing with the rights of a citizen of the United
States becomes wholly inoperative, because the &ldquo;law of the
land&rdquo; must forever remain fixed as at that moment, not to be
changed in regard to its citizens without a change of organic
law, and for some purposes not to be even so changed.</p>

<h3>THE CASES OF FIELDEN AND SPIES.</h3>

<p>General Butler then proceeded to a consideration of the
special and peculiar questions raised by the cases of Fielden

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">Pg&nbsp;208</a></span>

and Spies who are foreigners. He contended that treaties were
the supreme law of the land, and that these prisoners were
entitled, by virtue of treaties with Germany and Great Britain,
to all the rights and privileges of American citizens at the time
such treaties were made. A State had no power to try these
men by one of its own laws which was not the law of the land
at the time the treaties were ratified. He did not mean, he said,
that a foreigner could come into a State, and break its laws with
impunity and that the State could not touch him. But he did
mean that the State could only try him in accordance with the
law of the land&mdash;the whole land&mdash;at the time the treaty with
his government was made. This, he said, was an important
question to every American citizen, because in return for the
concession made by this government in the treaty with Great
Britain the government of that country had made similar concessions
to us. Suppose that a citizen of the United States
should go to Ireland and should make some remarks about the
advantages of a republican form of government, and should be
arrested and tried by the crimes act in violation of the treaty.
Would we not stand up and say that this man must be tried by
a fair and impartial jury? He must be tried as an Englishman
would have been tried at the time the treaty was made, and he
cannot be dealt with in a more summary way under a later law.</p>

<h3>GENERAL BUTLER&rsquo;S ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p>If this should happen, General Butler said, he hoped that
the English authorities would not be able to hold up to him a
decision of the United States Supreme Court sustaining the
right to try an Englishman by the local law of a State which
was nothing but a swamp and a howling wilderness at the time

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">Pg&nbsp;209</a></span>

the treaty was ratified.</p>

<p>Returning to the rights of States, General Butler said that
he was not prepared to deny that a State might change its
organic laws with the consent of all its citizens, but such change
would not bind a citizen of another State who had not assented
to them.</p>

<h3>IMPARTIAL JURIES AND NEWSPAPER LIES.</h3>

<p>After some desultory remarks about the record and the
necessity of laying it before the court, and another reference to
breaking open safes and desks, General Butler said: &ldquo;There is
no doubt that the prisoners were entitled to a trial by an impartial
jury&mdash;a stupid jury, if you please&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t think a
man who reads newspapers is any more competent to try a case&mdash;rather
worse if he pays any attention to their lies.&rdquo; As
enunciated by chief justices of the Supreme Court an impartial
juror, he said, is one who &ldquo;stands in freedom of mind, without
bias or prejudice, and is indifferent.&rdquo; The petitioners were not
tried by such a jury and are entitled to protection under the
federal constitution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the court is to give me jurors as
prejudiced as some of those in this case I had better go to a land
of Hottentots, for they would not allow me to be stolen and taken
back into Illinois.&rdquo; General Butler&rsquo;s allusion is to the
<del>kidnaping</del><ins>kidnapping</ins> of Ker, referred to by
counsel on the other side in defending their search and seizure.</p>

<p>In reply to Mr. Grinnell&rsquo;s statement that the records would
show that the defense were more ready to take the last juror
(Sanford) than the State was, General Butler said that they were
compelled to accept the last juror. Their peremptory challenges

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">Pg&nbsp;210</a></span>

were exhausted and they could do nothing else. Under these
circumstances they talked to him and coaxed him, and tried to
get him into a state of mind as favorable to their side as they
could. That was what the parts of the record referred to by
Mr. Grinnell would show, and nothing more.</p>

<h3>NO WAIVER OF RIGHTS IN CAPITAL CASES.</h3>

<p>General Butler then referred to the assertion of counsel on the
other side that the petitioners had <del>waved</del><ins>waived</ins>
some of their rights through not insisting upon them by exception or
objection at the proper time, and that therefore, they were estopped
from asserting these rights now in this court. He contended, however,
that when a man was on trial for his life there was no such thing as
a waiver or estoppal. In capital offences a prisoner cannot waive
wittingly or unwittingly anything that will affect the issue. In
support of this contention he cited the opinion of Chief Justice Shaw
in the case of Dr. Webster. The prisoners, he maintained, could not
now be barred out because they had not raised sufficiently formal
objections.</p>

<p>General Butler then returned again to the &ldquo;unreasonable
searches and seizures&rdquo; complained of by the petitioners, and
said his associate, Mr. Tucker, had characterized the proceeding as a
&ldquo;subp&oelig;n&aelig; duces tecum.&rdquo; executed by a locksmith.
&ldquo;Why your honors,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;they searched
under a burglary, headed by the State&rsquo;s attorney on his own
admission&mdash;no miserable policeman or half-witted constable, but
the State&rsquo;s prosecuting attorney does the burglary, steals the
papers, and says you can&rsquo;t help that. He puts it with a sort of
triumph, and yet we are told that our immunities and privileges are not
invaded, and our remedy is to sue for trespass. What a beautiful

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">Pg&nbsp;211</a></span>

remedy! Sue the State&rsquo;s attorney and be tried by such a
jury as the laws of Illinois would give. Better be in a place
not to be named for comfort.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>PRISONERS ABSENT WHEN SENTENCED.</h3>

<p>As a final reason why the writ should be granted, General
Butler urged that the prisoners had been sentenced to death in
their absence, and without being asked whether they had any
reason to give why sentence of death should not be pronounced
upon them. The record, he said, did not show that they were
absent when sentenced, but they could prove it. The record
showed that they were present, but they could prove by half
Chicago that this was a mistake.</p>

<p>In conclusion, General Butler said: &ldquo;May I, in closing,
make one observation? If men&rsquo;s lives can be taken in this way,
as you have seen exhibited here to-day, better anarchy, better
be without law, than with any such law.&rdquo; General Butler then
thanked the court for its indulgence and took his seat.</p>

<h3>UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT&rsquo;S DECISION NOVEMBER 2, 1887</h3>

<p>Is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>The court holds in brief: First, that the first ten
   amendments to the constitution are limitations upon federal
   and not upon State action: second, that the jury law of
   Illinois is upon its face valid and constitutional, and that
   it is similar in its provisions to the statute of Utah,
   which was sustained in this court in the case of Hopt vs.
   The Territory of Utah; third, that it does not appear in the
   record that upon the evidence the trial court should have
   declared the juror Sanford incompetent; fourth, that the
   objection to the admission of the Johann Most

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">Pg&nbsp;212</a></span>

   letter and the cross-examination of Spies, which counsel for
   the prisoners maintained virtually compelled them to testify
   against themselves, were not objected to in the trial court,
   and that therefore no foundation was laid for the exercise
   of this court&rsquo;s jurisdiction, and fifth, that the questions
   raised by General Butler in the cases of Spies and Fielden
   upon the basis of their foreign nationality were neither
   raised nor decided in the State courts, and therefore cannot
   be considered.</p>

   <p>The writ of error prayed for was consequently denied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no dissenting opinion.</p>

<p>The above decision of the Supreme Court was received by
the condemned anarchists with coolness amounting to indifference.
A. R. Parsons then handed the copy of a letter sent to
Governor Oglesby to the <cite>Daily News</cite> for publication, as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>To His Excellency Richard J. Oglesby, Governor of
the State of Illinois</em>&mdash;DEAR SIR:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>I am aware that petitions are being signed by hundreds
   of thousands of persons addressed to you, beseeching you to
   interpose your <del>perogative</del><ins>prerogative</ins>
   and commute the sentences of myself and comrades from death to
   imprisonment in the penitentiary. You are, I am told a good
   constitutional lawyer and a sincere man. I therefore beg of you
   to examine the record of the trial, and then conscientiously
   decide for yourself as to my guilt or innocence. I know that as
   a just man you will decide in accordance with the facts, the
   truth, and the justice of this case. But I write to reiterate
   the declaration made in my published appeal to the people of
   America September 21, 1887. I am guilty or I am innocent of the
   charge for which I have been condemned to die. If guilty, then
   I prefer death rather than to go &lsquo;like the quarry slave
   at night scourged to his dungeon&rsquo;. If innocent then I am
   entitled to and will

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">Pg&nbsp;213</a></span>

   accept nothing less than liberty. The records of the trial
   made in Judge Gary&rsquo;s court prove my innocence of the crime of
   murder. But there exists a conspiracy to judicially murder
   myself and imprisoned companions in the name and by virtue of
   the authority of the State. History records every despotic,
   arbitrary deed of the people&rsquo;s rulers as having been done
   in the name of the people, even to the destruction of the
   liberties of the people.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I am a helpless prisoner, completely in the power of
   the authorities, but I strongly protest against being taken
   from my cell and carried to the penitentiary as a felon.
   Therefore, in the name of the people, whose liberty is being
   destroyed; in the name of peace and justice, I protest against
   the consummation of this judicial murder, this proposed
   strangulation of freedom on American soil. I speak for myself,
   I know not what course others may pursue, but for myself
   I reject the petition for my imprisonment. I am innocent,
   and I say to you that under no circumstances will I accept
   a commutation to imprisonment. In the name of the American
   people I demand my right&mdash;my lawful, constitutional,
   natural, inalienable right to liberty. Respectfully yours,</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quotsig">&ldquo;A. R. PARSONS, Prison Cell 29.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On receipt of the decision of the Federal Court not to
interfere in the anarchists case, the doomed men were sullen.
Louis Lingg, the bomb-maker, was blatant and defiant, and said
to his attendants, &ldquo;I will never die on the scaffold,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;I hate and defy you all.&rdquo; A week before the execution
Lingg said: &ldquo;I approach my last moment cheerfully, but I will
not go alone.&rdquo; This was significant language, and no doubt was
an allusion to the fact that he intended to use the bombs, afterwards

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">Pg&nbsp;214</a></span>

found in his cell for the purpose of producing an explosion in the
jail that might have resulted in the death of scores of victims.
Lingg, <del>Engle</del><ins>Engel</ins>, Fischer and Parsons refused
absolutely and persistently to sign any petition to His Excellency,
Governor Oglesby, for executive clemency in the commutation of their
sentence to imprisonment. The following is a copy of letters from
Lingg, Engel and Fischer to Governor Oglesby. They demand liberty or
death:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cook County Jail</span>, November
1.&mdash;An open letter to Mr. R. J. Oglesby, Governor of the State of
Illinois.</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>Dear Sir: I am aware that petitions are being circulated
   and signed by the general public, asking you to commute the
   sentence of death which was inflicted upon me by a criminal
   court of this State. Anent the action of a sympathizing
   and well-meaning portion of the people, I solemnly declare
   that it has not my sanction. As a man of honor, as a man
   of conscience, and as a man of principle, I cannot accept
   mercy. I am <em>not guilty</em> of the charge in the
   indictment&mdash;&mdash;of murder. <em>I am no murderer</em>,
   and cannot apologize for an action of <em>which I know I
   am innocent</em>. And should I ask &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; on account of
   my principles, which I honorably believe to be true and
   noble! <em>No!</em> I am no hypocrite, and have, therefore,
   no excuses to offer with regard to being an anarchist,
   because the experiences of the past eighteen months have
   only strengthened my convictions. The question is: <em>Am
   I responsible for the death of the policemen at the
   Haymarket?</em> and I say no, unless you assent that every
   abolitionist could have been responsible for the deeds of John
   Brown. Therefore I could not ask or accept &ldquo;mercy&rdquo; without
   lowering myself in my self-estimation. If I cannot obtain
   <em>justice</em> from the authorities and be restored to my

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">Pg&nbsp;215</a></span>

   family, then I prefer that the verdict should be carried out
   as it stands. Every informed person must, I should think,
   admit that this verdict is solely due to class hatred,
   prejudice, the inflaming of public opinion by the malicious
   newspaper fraternity, and a desire on the part of the
   privileged classes to check the progressive labor movement.
   The interested parties, of course, deny this, but it is
   nevertheless true, and I am sure that coming ages will look
   upon our trial, conviction, and execution as the people of
   the <del>ninteenth</del><ins>nineteenth</ins> century regard
   the barbarities of past generations&mdash;as the outcome of
   intolerance and prejudice against advanced ideas. History
   repeats itself. As the powers that be have at all times thought
   that they could stem the progressive tide by exterminating a
   few &ldquo;kickers,&rdquo; so do the ruling classes of to-day
   imagine that they can put a stop to the movement of labor
   emancipation by hanging a few of its advocates. Progress in
   its victorious march has had to overcome many obstacles which
   seemed invincible, and many of its apostles have died the
   death of martyrs. The obstacles which bar the road to progress
   to-day seem to be invincible, too; but they will be overcome,
   nevertheless. At all times when the condition of society had
   become such, that a large portion of the people complained of
   the existing injustice, the ruling classes have denied the
   truth of these complaints, and have said that the discontent
   of the portion of the people in question was due only to
   the &ldquo;pernicious influence&rdquo; of &ldquo;malicious
   agitators.&rdquo; To-day, again, some people assert that the
   &ldquo;d----d agitators&rdquo; are the cause of the immense
   dissatisfaction among the working people! Oh, you people who
   speak thus, <em>can</em> you not, or <em>will</em> you not,
   read the signs of the time? Do you not see that the clouds on
   the social firmament are thickening? Are you not, for

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">Pg&nbsp;216</a></span>

   instance, aware that the control of industry and the means
   of transportation, etc., is constantly concentrating in
   fewer hands; that the monopolists, i. e., the sharks among
   the capitalists, swallow the little ones among them; that
   &ldquo;trusts,&rdquo; &ldquo;pools,&rdquo; and other
   combinations are being formed in order to more thoroughly
   and systematically fleece the people; that under the present
   system the development of technic and machinery is from year
   to year throwing more working men on the wayside; that in some
   parts of this great and fertile land a majority of the farmers
   are obliged to mortgage their homes in order to satisfy the
   greed of monstrous corporations; that, in short, the rich are
   constantly growing richer, and the poor poorer? Yes? And do
   you not comprehend that all these evils find their origin in
   the present institution of society which allows one portion
   of the human race to build fortunes upon the misfortunes of
   others; to enslave their fellow men? Instead of trying to
   remedy these evils, and instead of ascertaining just what the
   cause of the widening dissatisfaction is, the ruling classes,
   through their mouth-pieces, press, pulpit, etc.&mdash;defame
   and misrepresent the character, teachings, and motives of the
   advocates of social reconstruction, and use the rifle and the
   club on them, and, if opportunity is favorable, send them to
   the gallows and prisons. Will this do any good? As an answer
   I may as well quote the following words with which Benjamin
   Franklin closed his satirical essay, &ldquo;Rules for Reducing
   a Great Empire to a Small One,&rdquo; which he dedicated to
   the English government in 1776: &ldquo;Suppose all their (the
   &lsquo;kickers&rsquo;) complaints to be inverted, and promoted
   by a few factious demagogues, whom if you could catch and hang,
   all would be quiet. Catch and hang a few

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">Pg&nbsp;217</a></span>

   accordingly; and the blood of the martyrs shall work miracles
   in favor of your purpose&rdquo; (i. e., your own ruin).</p>

   <p>So, I say, society may hang a number of disciples of
   progress who have disinterestedly served the cause of the
   sons of toil which is the cause of humanity, but their
   blood will work miracles in bringing about the downfall of
   modern society, and in hastening the birth of a new era of
   civilization. Magna est veritas et prevalebet!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A letter to Governor Oglesby</span></p>

<blockquote>
   <p>Dear Sir&mdash;I, George Engel, citizen of the United
   States and of Chicago, and condemned to death, learn that
   thousands of citizens petition you as the highest executive
   officer of the State of Illinois, to commute my sentence from
   death to imprisonment. I protest emphatically against this on
   the following grounds: I am not aware of having violated any
   laws of this country. In my firm belief in the constitution
   which the founders of this republic bequeathed to this people
   and which remains unaltered, I have exercised the right of
   free speech, free press, free thought and free assemblage,
   as guaranteed by the constitution, and have criticised the
   existing condition of society, and succored my fellow-citizens
   with my advice, which I regard as the right of every honest
   citizen. The experience which I have had in this country,
   during the fifteen years that I have lived here, concerning
   the ballot and the administration of our public functionaries
   who have become totally corrupt, have eradicated my belief in
   the existence of equal rights of poor and rich, and the action
   of the public officers, police and militia have produced the
   firm belief in me that these conditions cannot last long. In
   accordance with this belief I have taught and advised. This I

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">Pg&nbsp;218</a></span>

   have done in good faith of the rights which are guaranteed
   by the constitution, and, not being conscious of my guilt,
   the &ldquo;powers that be&rdquo; may <em>murder</em> me, but they cannot
   <em>legally punish</em> me. I protest against a commutation of
   my sentence and demand either liberty or death. I renounce any
   kind of mercy.</p>

<p class="center">AN OPEN LETTER.</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>To Mr. R. J. Oglesby, Governor of Illinois: Anent the
   fact that the progressive and liberty-loving portion of
   the American people are endeavoring to prevail upon you to
   interpose prerogative in my case, I feel impelled to declare,
   with my friend and comrade Parsons, that I demand either
   liberty or death. If you are really a servant of the people
   according to the constitution of the country, then you will,
   by virtue of your office unconditionally release me.</p>

   <p>Referring to the general and inalienable rights of men.
   I have called upon the disinherited and oppressed masses
   to oppose the force of their oppressors&mdash;exercised by
   armed enforcement of infamous laws, enacted in the interest
   of capital&mdash;with force, in order to attain a dignified
   and manly existence by securing the full returns of their
   labor. This&mdash;and only this&mdash;is the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; which
   was proved against me, notwithstanding the employment of
   perjured testimony on the part of the State. And this crime is
   guaranteed not only as a right, but as a duty, by the American
   constitution, the representative of which you are supposed
   to be in the State of Illinois. But if you are not the
   representative of the constitution, like the great majority of
   officeholders, a mere tool of the monopolists or a specific

   <del>thrist</del><ins>thirst</ins> for blood displayed by the

   represent are themselves abashed at the monstrosity of my
   condemnation, and consequently, of their own violation of the
   most sacred rights of the people.</p>

   <p>Your decision in that event will not only judge me, but

<h3>FIELDEN SUES FOR MERCY.</h3>

<p>Fielden&rsquo;s letter is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>CHICAGO, Ill., Nov. 5, 1887.&mdash;<em>The Hon. Richard
   J. Oglesby, Governor State of Illinois</em>&mdash;SIR: I
   Samuel Fielden, a prisoner under sentence of death, and
   charged with complicity in the conspiracy to bring about the
   Haymarket massacre, pray your excellency for relief from the
   death sentence and respectfully beg your consideration of the
   following statement of facts:</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I was born in England in humble circumstances, and had
   little early education. For some years I devoted my life
   to religious work, being an authorized lay preacher in the
   Methodist denomination. I came to this country and settled in
   Chicago.

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">Pg&nbsp;220</a></span>

   At all times I was obedient to the law and conducted myself as
   a good citizen. I was a teamster and worked hard for my daily
   bread. My personal conduct and my domestic life were beyond
   reproach.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;Some three years or more ago I was deeply stirred by the
   condition of the working classes, and sought to do what I
   could for their betterment. I did this honestly, and with no
   sinister motive. I never sought any personal advantage out of
   the agitation in which I was engaged. I was gifted, as I was
   flattered and led to believe, with the faculty of stirring an
   audience with my words, and it was said that I was eloquent.
   I began delivering addresses to assemblages of the working
   classes, and spoke of their wrongs as I saw them. None of my
   speeches were prepared nor in any sense studied, and often
   they were born in an hour of intense excitement. It is true
   that I have said things in such heat that in calmer moments I
   should not have said. I made violent speeches. I suggested the
   use of force as a means for righting the wrongs which seemed
   to me to be apparent.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;I cannot admit that I used all of the words imputed to me
   by the State, nor can I pretend to remember the actual phrases
   I did utter. I am conscious, however, as I have said, that I
   was frequently aroused to a pitch of excitement which made me
   in a sense irresponsible. I was intoxicated with the applause
   of my hearers, and the more violent my language the more
   applause I received. My audience and myself mutually excited
   each other. I think, however, it is true that, for sensational
   or other purposes, words were put into my mouth and charged to
   me which I never uttered; but, whether this be true or not, I
   say now that I no longer believe it proper that any class of

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">Pg&nbsp;221</a></span>

   society should attempt to right its own wrongs by violence. I
   can now see that much that I said under excitement was unwise,
   and all this I regret. It is not true, however, that I ever
   consciously attempted to incite any man to the commission of
   crime. Although I do admit that I belonged to an organization
   <del>which </del>which was engaged at one time in preparing for
   a social revolution, I was not engaged in any conspiracy to
   manufacture or throw bombs. I never owned or carried a revolver
   in my life and did not fire one at the Haymarket. I had not the
   <del>slighest</del><ins>slightest</ins> idea that the meeting
   at the Haymarket would be other than a peaceable and orderly
   one, such as I had often addressed in this city, and was
   utterly astounded at its bloody outcome, and have always felt
   keenly the loss of life and suffering there occasioned.</p>

   <p>&ldquo;In view of these facts I respectfully submit that, while I
   confess with regret the use of extravagant and unjustifiable
   words, I am not a murderer. I never had any murderous intent,
   and I humbly pray relief from the murderer&rsquo;s doom. That these
   statements are true I do again solemnly affirm by every tie
   that I hold sacred, and I hope that your excellency will give
   a considerate hearing to the merits of my case, and also to
   those of my imprisoned companions who have been sentenced with
   me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quotsig">&ldquo;I remain, very respectfully,<br />
S. Fielden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above letter to the Governor by Samuel Fielden was
endorsed by Judge Gary and States Attorney Grinnell.</p>

<h3>SPIES&rsquo; LAST LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;CHICAGO, Ill., Nov. 6.&mdash;<em>Gov. Oglesby,
   Springfield, Ill.</em>&mdash;SIR: The fact that some of us
   have appealed to you for justice&mdash;under the pardoning
   prerogative&mdash;while others have not, should not enter into
   consideration in the decision of our case. Some

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">Pg&nbsp;222</a></span>

   of my friends have asked you for an absolute pardon. They
   feel the injustice done them so intensely that they cannot
   conciliate the idea of a commutation of sentence with the
   consciousness of innocence. The others (among them myself),
   while possessed of the same feeling of indignation, can
   perhaps more calmly and dispassionately look upon the matter
   as it stands. They do not disregard the fact that through a
   systematic course of lying, perverting, distorting, inventing,
   slandering, the press has succeeded in creating a sentiment of
   bitterness and hatred among a great portion of the populace
   that one man, no matter how powerful, how courageous, and just
   he be, cannot possibly overcome. They hold that to overcome
   that sentiment or the influence thereof would almost be a
   physiological impossibility. Not wishing, therefore, to place
   your excellency in a still more embarrassing position between
   the blind fanaticism or a misinformed public on one hand and
   justice on the other they concluded to submit their case to
   you unconditionally.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>WILLING TO DIE FOR HIS COMRADES.</h3>

<blockquote>
   <p>I implore you not to let this difference of action have
   any weight with you in determining our fate. During our
   trial the desire of the prosecutor to slaughter me, and to
   let my co-defendants off with milder punishment was quite
   apparent and manifest. It seemed to me then, and a great many
   of others, that the persecutors would be satisfied with one
   life&mdash;namely, mine. Grinnell, in his argument, intimated
   this very plainly. I care not to protest my innocence of any
   crime, and of the one I am accused of in particular. I have
   done that and leave the rest to the judgment of history.
   But to you I wish to address myself now as the alleged
   arch-conspirator (leaving the fact

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">Pg&nbsp;223</a></span>

   that I never have belonged to any kind of a conspiracy out
   of the question altogether). If a sacrifice of life there
   must be, will not my life suffice? The State&rsquo;s attorney of
   Cook county asked for no more. Take this, then! Take my life!
   I offer it to you so that you may satisfy the fury of a
   semi-barbaric mob, and save that of my comrades. I know that
   every one of my comrades is as willing to die, and perhaps
   more so than I am. It is not for their sake that I make this
   offer, but in the name of humanity and progress, in the
   interest of a peaceable&mdash;if possible&mdash;development
   of the social forces that are destined to lift our race upon
   a higher and better plane of civilization. In the name of the
   traditions of our country I beg you to prevent a seven-fold
   murder upon men whose only crime is that they are idealists,
   that they long for a better future for all. If legal murder

<h3>LINGG COMMITS SUICIDE.</h3>

<p>His Excellency, the Governor of Illinois, took action in the
anarchists&rsquo; case on November 10, commuting to imprisonment
for life the sentence of Samuel Fielden and Michael Schwab,
sending the death warrant of the remaining four to Sheriff Matson
by his son, Robert Oglesby, who arrived early on the morning

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">Pg&nbsp;224</a></span>

of the 11th of November. Prior to the Governor making
known his decision, Louis Lingg anticipating what his fate
would be, and in keeping with his threat, had by some process
unknown to the keepers, secured a fulminating cap such as is
used in exploding dynamite, which he coolly placed in his mouth,
and igniting the fuse which protruded from his mouth a short
distance, calmly awaited the end. A terrific report sounded in
the jail about 9 o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the day previous to
the day set for the execution. The deputies hastened in the
direction of the sound of the explosion and beheld clouds of
bluish-white smoke curling out from between the bars of the
door of Lingg&rsquo;s cell. On entering the cell Lingg was lying
upon his face. On turning him over he presented a ghastly
sight, the entire lower jaw was blown away, and the features
mutilated beyond recognition, only the stump of his tongue was
remaining, which fell back into the larynx and made respiration
difficult. He died in great agony at 2:45 of the same day. He
had eluded the disgrace of the hangman&rsquo;s noose and the ignominy
of a public execution.</p>

<p>During the ensuing night the gallows was erected in the
north corridor of the jail, and tested by heavy bags of sand to
make sure that everything was in working order.</p>

<h3>THE CONDEMNED MEN&rsquo;S LAST NIGHT.</h3>

<h3>SPIES AND DR. BOLTON.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The ex-editor of the &ldquo;Arbeiter
Zeitung&rdquo; refuses the minister&rsquo;s sympathy.</span></p>

<p>Not long after the death watch had been set the Rev. Dr.
Bolton, pastor of the First Methodist Episcopal church, called
upon the prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">Pg&nbsp;225</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/z267.jpg" width="400" height="446" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="continued">The reverend gentleman visited the whole four
unfortunates, and his reception was almost the same in every case.</p>

<p>Spies received him quietly and with a smile. &ldquo;I have called
on you, Mr. Spies,&rdquo; said the clergyman, &ldquo;to help you to prepare
for the awful end which is now but a few short hours away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spies smiled again, but shook his head slowly.
&ldquo;There is no use praying for me,&rdquo; he said in a
<del>meloncholy</del><ins>melancholy</ins> tone; &ldquo;I need them
not; you should reserve your prayers for those who need them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men then discussed matters of religion and social
economy, and Spies waxed warm in his defense of the doctrines
of socialism as it looked to him. The conversation was a long
and somewhat rambling one, and finally Mr. Bolton arose, bade
Spies adieu, and left him.</p>

<p>When he had gone the latter turned to the two deputies
(Quirk and Josephson) who kept watch over him, and with a
short laugh exclaimed: &ldquo;Now, what can you do with men like
that? One doesn&rsquo;t like to insult them, and yet one finds it hard
to endure their unlooked-for attentions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Spies then waxed talkative and aired his opinion freely to
his death watch, Deputy John B. Hartke. Speaking of the
anarchists&rsquo; trial, he said that its conduct and the finding were
without precedence in the history of this country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that when the jury
brought in the verdict they were all so badly frightened that
they trembled, and the judge himself, when he pronounced the
sentence, shook like a leaf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This, he said, looked bad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The anarchists had no reason to be afraid, but the judge
and the jury had good reason to be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">Pg&nbsp;226</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; said Deputy Hartke, &ldquo;that I had heard that
Fischer had signed a petition to the Governor asking for mercy,
and added that I had heard he had done the same thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;I said in my letter to
the Governor that if one was to be murdered, I was the one.
That is the kind of a document I signed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;in five or six years from now
the people will see the error of hanging us, if they do not see
it sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this Spies, who had been lying on his back with his
hands above his head, removed them and turned on his side with
his face to the wall.</p>

<p>The anarchist editor then lay down on the bed, and with his white
face upturned, talked continuously with Deputy Hartke about mutual
acquaintances and things and events of days gone by. He never referred
to to-morrow, and seemed <del>desirious</del><ins>desirous</ins> of
keeping the thoughts of his approaching execution as far as possible
from his mind.</p>

<p>Engel grew a little more serious as the night wore on, and
when he came to be more familiar with the death watch (Deputies
Bombgarten and Hastige) he talked with them about the
cause for which he was about to die. He protested his innocence
over and over again, and told the story of the Haymarket
riot, and all he knew of it.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Bolton called on Engel as he did on the others,
but with the same unsatisfactory result. The wretched Engel
dwelt with bitter emphasis upon the fact that it was the informer
Waller, who afterward swore his life away, that first informed
him of the massacre. &ldquo;I was drinking beer and playing cards
with my neighbors when Waller called and taunted me with not

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">Pg&nbsp;227</a></span>

being down in the Haymarket fight,&rdquo; said Engel, as a big lump
seemed to rise in his throat, &ldquo;and he afterward swore my life
away, but I die for a just cause.&rdquo; Engel slept none until about
1 o&rsquo;clock, but at that hour, just as the death watch was being
removed, he turned round in his couch and dropped into a light
slumber.</p>

<h3>FISCHER AND PARSONS.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Both refuse spiritual comfort and
Parsons sings &ldquo;Annie Laurie.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Fischer&rsquo;s last night was quietly spent. He talked but little,
but was restless. His death watch, Deputies Healy and Shomberg,
said though he did not sleep much, he appeared to take
the terrible ordeal put upon him with great composure&mdash;almost
indifference. He, too, coldly repulsed Dr. Bolton&rsquo;s proffered
spiritual aid. Though his sleepless eyes stared vacantly at the wall
of his cell, he talked but little. No sign of nervousness or fear
could be traced on the hard, clear-cut features. He was evidently
prepared to meet his fate unflinchingly and to die boldly.
&ldquo;Annie Laurie,&rdquo; sung in a fairly good tenor voice, broke the
the silence. It was approaching 12 o&rsquo;clock. A dread silence
overhung all. All along the anarchists&rsquo; corridor not a sound
was to be heard. The absence of any noise might be likened to
the stillness of the grave. Criminals were asleep. The indications
were that the anarchists were asleep too.</p>

<p>But hardly so. Parsons was awake, and the spirit of his
wakeful hours urged him to sing &ldquo;Annie Laurie.&rdquo; Soldiers in
a foreign clime have shed tears at the strains of this song. It is
a passport to the emotions the world wide. And almost within

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">Pg&nbsp;228</a></span>

the shadow of the gallows tree, when life was to be registered
by hours, Parsons&rsquo; striking up this song seemed certainly suggestive
of the fate he felt to be close at hand. There was in
his tone a lonesome melancholy as he sung the first stanza, then
on the second one his voice wavered and finally broke. He was
cast down. The memory of his wife and little ones seemed to
rise before him, a sob, full of pathetic despair served as a period
to his further recitation. Once stopped singing, Parsons was in
tears. He cried within the quietness of his cell, not through
fear of his approaching death, so far as his demeanor indicated.
Rather it was due to recollection busy with scenes of the man&rsquo;s
early life. His boyhood came back to him as he sung that old
song. He could not do else than break down.</p>

<p>When Dr. Bolton called upon Parsons he was received with
the same courtesy which has always distinguished that erudite
anarchist. The condemned man, however, did not seem to take
kindly to the proffered ministrations of the clergyman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are welcome, Dr. Bolton,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;pray, what can I
do for you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reverend visitor explained his mission, and the old
cynical expression stole over Parsons&rsquo; face. &ldquo;Preachers are all
Pharisees,&rdquo; he sneered, &ldquo;and you know what Jesus Christ&rsquo;s
opinion of the Pharisees was. He called them a generation of
vipers, and likened them to whited sepulchers. I don&rsquo;t desire to
have anything to do with either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Bolton remonstrated a little, and finally Parsons appeared
to be relenting somewhat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will say that while I do not absolutely
refuse your kind attentions, I will impress on you the
fact that I did not want you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">Pg&nbsp;229</a></span></p>

<p>A desultory conversation ensued, and the missionary, on leaving,
told Parsons that he would pray earnestly for him during
the night.</p>

<p>The anarchist&rsquo;s hard gray eye grew moist, and he
<del>murmered</del><ins>murmured</ins> hoarsely: &ldquo;Thank
you,&rdquo; but added: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, though, I
didn&rsquo;t send for you.&rdquo;</p>

<del>MARSELLAISE</del>
<h3>SINGING THE <ins>MARSEILLAISE</ins>.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Parsons talks freely to the death
watch and sings for them.</span></p>

<p>Parsons slept little but kept heart marvelously well. He
chatted with the guards on the death watch and furnished them
each with his autograph in this form:</p>

<p class="quotsig">&ldquo;Cook County Jail,<br />
Cell No. 4.<br />
<em>A. R. Parsons.</em><br />
<br />
Nov. 11, 1887.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With Bailiffs Rooney and Jones he calmly discussed the outlook,
touched without emotion upon his pending death, and
dwelt with satisfaction upon his assurance of his wife&rsquo;s ability
to maintain herself. When told by the guards that Spies was
deeply affected by the parting with his wife and complained that
of all the incidents of the unnerving time, it most deeply moved
him; that Fischer, though reckless of himself, bemoaned the
destitution of his young and feeble wife, Parsons feebly
expressed his sympathy for his companions and rejoiced that he
left behind a lion-hearted wife, and children too young to
keenly feel bereavement. Then he commented upon social conditions
both here and abroad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will sing you a song,&rdquo; he said about 1 o&rsquo;clock,
&ldquo;a song

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">Pg&nbsp;230</a></span>

born as a battle-cry in France, and now accepted as the hymn
of revolution the world over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a low voice he then sang a paraphrased translation of &ldquo;La
<del>Marsellaise</del><ins>Marseillaise</ins>,&rdquo; which the guards
commended as both inspiring and well performed.</p>

<h3>TELEGRAMS TO PARSONS.</h3>

<p class="center">A couple of cheering missives received this morning.</p>

<p>Following are copies of the two dispatches received by A.
R. Parsons a short time before his execution this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;BOSTON, Nov. 11.&mdash;<em>Albert R. Parsons, Cook
   County Jail</em>: Not good-by, but hail brothers. From the
   gallows-trap the march will be taken up. I will listen for the
   beating of the drum.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quotsig">JOSEPHINE TILTON.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;ST. LOUIS, Mo., Nov. 11.&mdash;<em>Albert R. Parsons,
   Prisoner</em>: Glorious martyr, in the name of social progress
   bravely meet your fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quotsig">C. R. DAVIS.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To the sender of the first telegram Parsons desired that his
red-silk handkerchief be sent.</p>

<h3>PARSONS LAST LETTER.</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A copy of the document sent to a
new york paper.</span></p>

<p>NEW YORK, Nov. 12.&mdash;The letter which Parsons wrote yesterday
morning was addressed to a resident of this city, and
appears in the <cite>Herald</cite> to-day, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;COUNTY JAIL, Nov. 11, 8 o&rsquo;clock a. m.&mdash;<em>My Dear
   Comrades</em>: The guard has just awakened me. I have washed
   my face and drank a cup of coffee. The doctor asked me if I
   wanted stimulants. I said no. The dear boys, Engel, Fischer,

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">Pg&nbsp;231</a></span>

   and Spies, saluted me with firm voices. Please see Sheriff
   Matson and take charge of my papers and letters. Please have
   my book on &ldquo;Anarchism: Its Philosophy and Scientific Basis&rdquo;,
   put into good shape. There are millions of Americans who
   will want to read it. Well, my dear old comrade, the hour
   draws near. C&aelig;sar kept me awake till late last night
   with the noise, music of hammer and saw erecting his throne,
   my scaffold&mdash;refinement, civilization. Matson, the
   sheriff, tells me he refused to let C&aelig;sar&mdash;the
   State&mdash;secrete my body, and he has just got my wife&rsquo;s
   address from me to send her my remains. Magnanimous
   C&aelig;sar! Good-by. Hail the social revolution! Salutations
   to all.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>The following description of the execution is copied from
the <cite>Daily News</cite>:</p>

<p>August Spies, Adolph Fischer, George
<del>Engle</del><ins>Engel</ins>, and A. R. Parsons, the four
anarchists who were tried a year ago, and found guilty of the murder of
Mathias A. Degan in the Haymarket square on May 4, 1886, were to-day
hanged in the Cook county jail and paid the penalty of their crime with
their lives. The drop fell at 11:53 and the four men died with words of
defiance

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">Pg&nbsp;232</a></span>

and scorn upon their lips. Parsons&rsquo; last word was actually
strangled in his throat by the hangman&rsquo;s noose. Seldom, if
ever, have four men died more gamely and defiantly than the
four who were strangled to-day.</p>

<p>When the word passed around, about 11 o&rsquo;clock, that the
final hour had indeed arrived, men&rsquo;s faces grew pale and
the hum of excitement passed through the crowd. They were
quickly marshaled and marched down in a line to the gallows
corridor.</p>

<p>At 10:55 fully two hundred and fifty newspaper men, local
politicians, and others, among them the twelve jurors to
view the bodies after execution, had passed through the dark
passage under the gallows and began seating themselves. The
bailiff said a few words to the journalists, begging them to
make no rush when the drop fell, but to wait decently and in
order.</p>

<p>Parsons was given a cup of coffee a few minutes before the
march to the scaffold was begun.</p>

<p>The rattling of chairs, tables and benches continued for
several minutes, but by 10:05 there began to fall a hush,
and conversation among the crowd sank almost to a whisper.
The bare, whitewashed walls formed a painful contrast with
the dark-brown gallows, with its four noosed ropes hanging
ominously near the floor.</p>

<p>It was exactly 11:50 o&rsquo;clock when Chief Bailiff Cahill
entered the corridor and stood beneath the gallows. He
requested in solemn tones that the gentlemen present would
remove their hats. Instantly every head was bared. Then the
tramp, tramp of many footsteps was heard resounding from the
central corridor, and the crowd in front of the gallows knew
that the condemned men had begun the march of death. The slow,
steady march sounded nearer and nearer.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
   <img src="images/z277.jpg" width="400" height="582" alt="" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">Pg&nbsp;233</a></span></p>

<p>The anarchists were within a few feet of the scaffold. There was
a pause. The condemned men were about to mount the stairway leading
to the last platform from which they would ever speak. Step by step,
steadily they mounted the stairway, and again there was another slight
pause. Every eye was bent upon the metallic angle around which the
four wretched victims were expected to make their appearance. A moment
later their curiosity was rewarded. With steady, unfaltering step a
white-robed figure stepped out from behind the protecting metallic
screen and stood upon the drop. It was August Spies. It was evident
that his hands were firmly bound behind him underneath his snowy
shroud.</p>

<p>He walked with a firm, almost stately tread across the platform
and took his stand under the left-hand noose at the corner
of the scaffold farthest from the side at which he had entered.
Very pale was the expressive face, and a solemn, far-away light
shone in his blue eyes. His tawny hair was brushed back in
the usual crisp waves from the big white forehead. Nothing
could be imagined more melancholy, and at the same time dignified,
than the expression which sat upon the face of August
Spies at that moment. The chin was covered with a freshly budding
beard and partially concealed the expression of the firmly-cut
mouth. The lines were a little hardly drawn around the
corners, however, and bespoke great internal tension. He stood
directly behind the still noose, which reached down almost to
his breast, and, having first cast a momentary glance upward at
the rope, let his eyes fall upon the 200 faces that were upturned
toward him. Never a muscle did he move, however; no sign
of flinching or fear could be discerned in the white face&mdash;white
almost as the shroud which it surmounted.</p>

<p>Spies had scarcely taken his place when he was followed by

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">Pg&nbsp;234</a></span>

Fischer. He, too, was clad in a long white shroud that was
gathered in at the ankles. His tall figure towered several inches
over that of Spies, and as he stationed himself behind his particular
noose his face was very pale, but a faint smile rested upon
his lips. Like Spies, the white robe set off to advantage the
rather pleasing features of Fischer, and as the man stood there
waiting for his last moment his pale face was as calm as if he
were asleep. Next came George Engel. There was a ruddy
glow upon the rugged countenance of the old anarchist, and
when he ranged himself alongside Fischer he raised himself to
his full height, while his burly form seemed to expand with the
feelings that were within him. Last came Parsons. His face
looked actually handsome, though it was very pale. When he
stepped upon the gallows he turned partially sideways to the
dangling noose and regarded it with a fixed, stony gaze&mdash;one of
mingled surprise and curiosity. Then he straightened himself
under the fourth noose, and, as he did so, he turned his big gray
eyes upon the crowd below with such a look of awful reproach
and sadness as could not fail to strike the innermost chord of
the hardest heart there. It was a look never to be forgotten.
There was an expression almost of inspiration on the white,
calm face, and the great, stony eyes seemed to burn into men&rsquo;s
hearts and ask: &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There they stood upon the scaffold, four white-robed figures,
with set, stoical faces, to which it would seem no influence could
bring a tremor of fear.</p>

<p>And now a bailiff approaches, and, seizing Parsons&rsquo; robe, passed
a leathern strap around his ankles. In a moment they were
closely pinioned together. Engel&rsquo;s legs were next strapped
together, and when the official approached Fischer, the latter

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">Pg&nbsp;235</a></span>

straightened up his tall figure to its full height and placed his
ankles close together to facilitate the operation. Spies was the
last, but he was the first around whose neck the fatal cord was
placed. One of the attendant bailiffs seized the noose in front
of Spies and passed it deftly over the doomed man&rsquo;s head. It
caught over his right ear, but Spies, with a shake of his head,
cast it down around his neck, and then the bailiff tightened it
till it touched the warm flesh, and carefully placed the noose
beneath the left ear.</p>

<p>When the officer approached Fischer threw back his head
and bared his long, muscular throat by the movement.</p>

<p>Fischer&rsquo;s neck was very long and the noose nestled snugly
around it. When it was tightened around his windpipe Fischer
turned around to Spies and laughingly whispered something in
Spies&rsquo; ear. But the latter either did not hear him or else was
too much occupied with other thoughts to pay attention. Engel
smiled down at the crowd, and then turning to Deputy Peters,
who guarded him, he smiled gratefully toward him and whispered
something to the officer that seemed to affect him. It
looked at first as if Engel were about to salute his guard with a
kiss, but he evidently satisfied himself with some word of peace.
Parson&rsquo;s face never moved as the noose dropped over his head,
but the same terrible, fixed look was on his face.</p>

<p>And now people were expecting that the speeches for which
the four doomed ones craved twenty minutes each this morning
would be delivered, but to every one&rsquo;s surprise the officer who
had adjusted the noose proceeded to fit on the white cap without
delay. It was first placed on Spies&rsquo; head, completely hiding
his head and face. Just before the cap was pulled over Fischer&rsquo;s
head Deputy Spears turned his eyes up to meet those of the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">Pg&nbsp;236</a></span>

tall young anarchist. Fischer smiled down on his guard just
as pleasantly as Engel did on his, and he seemed to be whispering
some words of forgiveness, but it may have been otherwise,
as not even the faintest echo reached the men in the
corridor below. Engel and Parsons soon donned their white
caps after this, and now the four men stood upon the scaffold
clad from top to toe in pure white.</p>

<p>All was ready now for the signal to let the drop fall. In
the little box at the back of the stage and fastened to the wall
the invisible executioner stood with axe poised, ready to cut the
cord that held them between earth and heaven. The men had
not noticed this but they knew the end was near.</p>

<p>For an instant there was a dead silence, and then a mournful
solemn voice sounded from behind the first right-hand mask,
and cut the air like a wail of sorrow and warning. Spies was
speaking from behind his shroud.</p>

<p>The words seemed to drop into the cold, silent air like pellets
of fire. Here is what he said: &ldquo;It is not meet that I should
speak here, where my silence is more terrible than my utterances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a deeper, stronger voice came out with a muffled, mysterious
cadence from behind the white pall that hid the face of
Fischer. He only spoke eight words: &ldquo;This is the happiest
moment of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the next voice that catches up the refrain is a different
one. It is firm, but the melancholy wail was not in it. It was
harsh, loud, exultant. Engel was cheering for anarchy. &ldquo;Hurrah
for anarchy! Hurrah!&rdquo; were the last words and the last
cheer of George Engel.</p>

<p>But now the weird and ghastly scene was brought to a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">Pg&nbsp;237</a></span>

climax. Parsons alone remained to speak. Out from behind
his mask his voice sounded more sad, and there was a more
dreary, reproachful tone in it than even in Spies. &ldquo;May I be
allowed to speak? Oh, men of America!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;may I
be allowed the privilege of speech even at the last moment?
HARKEN TO THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a sudden pause. Parsons never spoke a word
more. A sharp, creaking noise, a crash, a sickening, cracking
sound, and Spies, Parsons, Fischer, and Engel were no more.</p>

<p>When the pulse-beats of all became imperceptible, which
was about 12:10 o&rsquo;clock, the physicians sat down and the bodies
swung back and forth, while the deputies stood above them.
There was a continual shifting of seats after the physicians left
the bodies, and nearly all who could get away wanted to be
allowed to do so. The sheriff opened a door at the west side of
the building and a great many of the spectators left.</p>

<p>At 12:20 Spies&rsquo; body was let down and placed in a coffin,
while the doctor examined him and found that the neck was not
broken. He wore a dark-gray flannel shirt and dark pantaloons,
but no coat. His arms were confined by a strap, as were
those of all the others.</p>

<p>Fischer was next cut down. His neck was not broken. He
wore a blue flannel shirt and gray trousers.</p>

<p>Engel came next. He had a blue flannel shirt and wore a collar.
His neck was broken, but the spinal cord was not severed.</p>

<p>Parsons was the last to be taken down. He was clad in a
neat black suit, but had only an undershirt on.</p>

<p>When all the bodies had been arranged in the coffins the
physicians made another examination, and then the lids were
placed on the coffins, and the work was done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">Pg&nbsp;238</a></span></p>

<p>The condemned men directed that their bodies be turned
over to their wives, except Spies, who wanted his body given to
his mother. Their wishes were respected, and Coroner Hertz
has directed that the body of Lingg be given to Mrs. Engel and
the Carpenters&rsquo; Union, in accordance with Lingg&rsquo;s request, so
that they may all be buried together.</p>

<p>Since the conviction and condemnation of the anarchists of Haymarket
notoriety in 1886, the whole world has stood with breathless anxiety
watching for the ultimate, and no other avenue was left open but to
inflict the penalty commensurate with their crime. Officers of the law
frequently received letters <del>threatning</del><ins>threatening</ins>
to wreak a summary vengeance upon them providing the sentence
was carried out. The condemned maintained a bold and belligerent
attitude, while every means to intimidate and thwart justice which
the machinations of the nefarious Herr Most could devise, and his
minions could hurl life flaming brands broadcast amid a peace-loving
and contented people have been resorted to. But pitying justice wept
with drooping head o&rsquo;er the stern necessity which called for the
interposition of her iron hand having discarded the scepter for the
rod. When the hand of outraged law and justice is raised the blow must
fall in order to vindicate the majesty of the law. America has set the
foot of the Goddess of Liberty upon the neck of anarchy and crushed the
serpent brood.</p>

<h3>AFTER THE EXECUTION.</h3>

<p>Two hours after the terrible and disagreeable duty of Sheriff
Matson had been performed, in the name, and for the peace of
the State of Illinois, in the execution of the four condemned
anarchists, their bodies had been delivered to their friends, the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">Pg&nbsp;239</a></span>

gallows had been taken down and stowed in its accustomed
place, and not one vestige of the awful punishment which had
just been inflicted remained to tell that anything out of the
ordinary had transpired.</p>

<p>Every good citizen and right-thinking American will join
with me in extending to their afflicted widows and orphan
children sincere and heart-felt commiseration for the calamity
which has befallen them. While the law inflicts punishment
for its violation, it does it for the public good. Mercy was not
to be considered longer in their case. &ldquo;Mercy to the guilty is
cruelty to the innocent.&rdquo; The great book of law is prefaced
with these words. Justice is the unchanged everlasting will to
give each man his right. The right to free speech had been
accorded to these men, and it had been abused. Under the diabolical
teachings of Herr Most, anarchy promised soon to become
the ruling power. But they have, we trust, ascertained that
America is a poor and barren soil in which to cause anarchy to
grow and flourish. They have found that though the mills of
God grind slow, yet they grind exceeding fine.</p>

<p>We shall forever be surprised beyond expression at the
words made use of at the funeral of the anarchists on Sunday,
November 13, by Captain Black, in his oration over the bodies
of these outlaws. He was said to have used the following words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the love of truth they died,&rdquo; said the orator. &ldquo;They
fought for a cause, believing themselves in the right, and in the
years to come they will be loved and revered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Black was followed by other speakers who made
use of language very expressive and forcible.</p>

<p>T. J. Morgan followed with a speech in which he dwelt on
the last words of the men before the drop fell. The immense

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">Pg&nbsp;240</a></span>

throng at the grave became excited and frequently interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the voice of the people be heard,&rdquo; he cried, in Parson&rsquo;s
last words. When he spoke of the majesty of the law a voice
cried: &ldquo;Throttle the law!&rdquo; When he asked: &ldquo;Shall we be
revenged on Bonfield, Grinnell, Gary, and Oglesby?&rdquo; voices
cried: &ldquo;Yes, yes! Hang them!&rdquo; Albert Currlin, formerly
of the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, spoke in German and called the laboring
men cowards for permitting the &ldquo;five-fold murder.&rdquo;</p>

   museum of weapons and infernal machines. Easy lessons in the

</div>

<p>NEW YORK, Nov. 4, 1887.</p>

<p>Since Johann Most&rsquo;s release I had often resolved to visit his
editorial sanctum and see some of his surroundings, but I never
had the opportunity until a few days ago, when I sought William
street and paused a moment before 167. This is the place
where undiluted anarchy presents itself through the medium of
the Freiheit, which has succeeded so well that it has been
enlarged to double its former size. On the ground floor a lager-beer
saloon is doing a thriving business, and the old saying that
Teutonic journalism always manifests an inclination to take up
its abode in proximity to a place where honors are paid to King
Gambrinus is borne out in this instance, even when the journalists
wage war on all other monarchs.</p>

<p>Entering the hallway you will notice, as soon as your eyes

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">Pg&nbsp;241</a></span>

are able to penetrate the darkness, a large red banner on the
wall bearing the inscription, &ldquo;Vive la Commune.&rdquo; A cast-iron
letter-box, marked &ldquo;John Most,&rdquo; attracts one&rsquo;s attention for a
moment, and then we ascend two flights of narrow, creaky stairs,
and step into a large, dilapidated room, extending over the
entire top floor of the building. Here the <cite>Freiheit</cite> is written,
put into type, and, after being printed elsewhere, mailed to subscribers.
There is hardly a country on the globe which has not
the honor of giving shelter to some anarchist subscriber. A
perfect deluge of revolutionary pamphlets issues from this forlorn-looking
loft.</p>

<p>About a dozen men were engaged in folding and wrapping
the latest number of the <cite>Freiheit</cite>. In order to keep up their
spirits at this hard work a goodly quantity of the favorite German
beverage is consumed, cigars and short pipes emit big
clouds of smoke, and a noisy debate is carried on all the time.
Every one of these savage-looking specimens of humanity strives
to assume an air that suggests his merely waiting for a favorable
opportunity to slaughter all monarchs and capitalists on the face
of the earth. There are Germans, Frenchmen, Russians, Bohemians,
and a Dane in the group. Regular employment is a
notion too conservative and utterly foreign to their minds. They
are here folding papers to serve the revolutionary cause, and
receive no other recompense than the consciousness of having
performed their duty.</p>

<h3>OVERAWING THE VISITORS.</h3>

<p>One of the heroes, who evidently desires to overawe us,
takes a small quantity of gun cotton out of his pocket, another
produces a sample of dynamite, and each asserts that the stuff

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">Pg&nbsp;242</a></span>

he carries is an excellent agent to further the grand idea of universal
anarchy. All join in a dispute concerning the most
effective methods for blowing up public institutions, and the
folding business is meanwhile neglected. The anarchist chief,
Herr Most, has been conversing with a good-looking young
female anarchist, who came over for the purpose of paying her
respects to the great dynamiter; but now his attention is directed
to his hot-headed disciples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get through your work,&rdquo; he shouts; &ldquo;you may babble all
you want afterward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The admonition is heeded only for a few moments. The
folders have a theme demanding urgent action. The sentence
of the Chicago anarchists has excited the wrath and of every
anarchist and frenzied cries of threatened vengeance burst forth
from all sides. Herr Most again commands silence, and his
announcement that a mass-meeting would be held on Sunday, at
which both English and German speakers would be present, is
hailed with tumultuous applause. The presence of strangers
seems to be totally ignored for the moment. The anarchists
fully understand that they are at liberty here to run the revolutionary
machine at their own sweet pleasure, so long as the
struggle is confined to the tongue. I conclude to invest 5 cents,
and a copy of the <cite>Freiheit</cite> is handed to me. The editor reflects
upon the propriety of a national thanksgiving. His language
is not choice, but rather painfully harsh. Here is a goodly
specimen:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our army of the unemployed, probably, will give thanks
that the capitalists are so very prosperous. Poor, haggard
women will give thanks over their weak tea and dry baker&rsquo;s
bread that they have been allowed to lay up wealth for their

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">Pg&nbsp;243</a></span>

employers. Factory children, who never see anything but the
grim shop walls by daylight, will give thanks that they have
been brought into this beautiful world, and hard-working day
laborers lucky enough to have any kind of a job will give thanks
that the cormorants of society have not taken the last mouthful
away from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another article deals with the anti-Chinese movement on the
Pacific coast, and urges the white working men to expel every
greedy monopolist instead of persecuting the poor celestial.</p>

<h3>ANARCHISTIC LITERATURE AND WEAPONS.</h3>

<p>Before I proceed to inspect the curiously decorated walls my
attention is called to an assortment of anarchistic literature
spread on a large table. The most extraordinary productions of
fever-brained revolutionists from all countries are here exposed
for sale. The works of Herr Most occupy the most conspicuous place,
and titles like &ldquo;Gottespect und Religrionsenche,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Eigenthumsbestie,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elements of Revolutionary
Warfare&rdquo; <del>embelish</del><ins>embellish</ins> the title pages.
I open the last book at haphazard and read:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best of all preparations to be used for poisoning is
<del>curari</del><ins>curare</ins>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By heating a dagger and then tempering it in oil of oleander,
the infliction of a light wound would be sufficient to produce
blood-poisoning and death.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cheapest and least expensive way is to apply a mixture
of red phosphorus and gum arabicum to the dagger, cartridge,
etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This precious stuff (dynamite), which is able to blast a
mass of solid rock, might also do good service at an assembly of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">Pg&nbsp;244</a></span>

royal or aristocratic personages, or at an entertainment patronized
by monopolists.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Most, who had eyed me sharply, asked at last: &ldquo;Would
you like to join our circle, or perhaps it is only a few of your
private enemies you contemplate doing up? All necessary
information can be had by studying my &lsquo;Kriegswissencraft.&rsquo;&rdquo;
The hint was a broad one, and I thought it the safest plan to
spend a dime on the &ldquo;murder pamphlet,&rdquo; thus propitiating the
tiger in his den.</p>

<p>The room might be considered at first glance an armory.
There are revolvers of all constructions, daggers, rifles, infernal
machines, and a big saber with a rusty scabbard. I could
scarcely repress a laugh at this relic of the great French revolution,
or some equally remote historic event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make a mistake by laughing,&rdquo; said Most, unsheathing
the sword. &ldquo;You will observe the blade is as sharp as a razor,
and,&rdquo; he added with a certain pride, &ldquo;the point is, by way of
experiment, coated with a solution of cyanide of potassium.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The majority of the rifles are breech-loaders, formerly used
in the United States army, and bought by Most in large lots at
auction for retailing among his followers. On a shelf above the
editor&rsquo;s desk a variety of the most dangerous poisons, liquid and
solid, are openly exposed. The anarchist chief remarked, with
a grim smile, that he seriously contemplated breeding cholera
and yellow-fever germs for the purpose of exterminating mankind,
rather than suffer the present condition of society to perpetuate
itself.</p>

<h3>WALL DECORATIONS.</h3>

<p>The walls of the room are almost totally covered with pictures,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">Pg&nbsp;245</a></span>

portraits, newspaper headings, etc. In crazy-quilt fashion
is arranged Lieske, Shakspere, Hoedel, Rousseau, Karl Marx,
Feurbach, Stuart Mill, Thomas Paine, Richard Wagner, Marat,
Hans Sachs, St. Simon, Lassalle, Proudhon, Anton Kammerer,
Stallmacher, the Irish patriots, Brady, Kelly, Curley, Tynan,
Wilson, Gallagher, and Normann, a life-size picture of Louise
Michel, an excellent photograph of prince Krapotkine, pictures
from Puck, Punch, Fleigende Blatter, sketches from George
Eber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo;&mdash;a queer collection indeed.</p>

<p>Herr Most takes especial pride in a gibbet traced in red
lines on the whitewashed wall and bearing portraits of the following
persons: The emperors of Germany, Russia, and Austria,
Queen Victoria, President Grevey, King Humbert, King Christian
of Denmark and his premier, Estrup; the Shah of Persha;
the Sultan, the Emperors of China, Japan, and Brazil, and President
Cleveland. As an illustration of the bitter feeling prevailing
between the anarchists and socialists was a caricature of
Alexander Jonas, the socialist politician, playing a flute to the
inspiring tune, &ldquo;Wait Till the Clouds Roll By.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The German Chancellor, Prince Bismarck, is caricatured a
dozen different ways, and blood-thirsty sentiments are written
beneath the pictures. A large picture presents the famous Rus-conspirators
against Alexander II.; another recalls the trial of
Reinsdorf and comrades, charged with high treason; then follow
some scenes from the Paris commune in 1871, and next to
these sanguinary sketches an elegant fan is suspended, unconscious
of its strange surroundings. Anarchistic papers from
every quarter of the world are pasted from ceiling to floor, and
we learn the existence of obscure journals like Ni Dieu, Ni
Maitre, Fackel, Le Cri du Peuple, Alarm, Lucifer, Revolte, La

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">Pg&nbsp;246</a></span>

Question Sociale, the Roumelian periodical Revista Sociale, Il
Fascio Operairo, Der Arme Teufel, and Proletaren. Italians
who stray into this nest have an opportunity of studying a
&ldquo;Programma Socialista, Anarchico, Revoluzionario del Giuppo
Italiano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps the master of this queer den will soon view the
world once more through prison bars.</p>

<h3>THE PAST CAREER OF HERR MOST.</h3>

<p>That practice has now become obsolete of predicting the future of a
child by consulting the aspect of the planet under which it was born at
the day and hour of birth. At the advent of Herr Most upon this mundane
sphere, who, looking through the horroscope of his future, but could in
the interests of humanity, have wished that the feeble spark of life
in the frail <del>teniment</del><ins>tenement</ins> might have become
extinguished, or that it had never existed.</p>

<p>In the city of Augsburg on the River Lech, which is a tributary
of the blue rolling Danube in Bavaria in Germany, in
the year 1846, and on the 5th day of February Herr Most first
saw the light of day. A long period of sickness while yet an

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">Pg&nbsp;247</a></span>

infant served to render his features hideous by some malignant
disease eating away a portion of his cheek, but his record goes
to prove conclusively that he still retained enough to render
himself obnoxious to every lover of law and order.</p>

<p>Endowed by nature with <del>procivities</del><ins>proclivities</ins>
to resist all rule and law, gained from an unloving stepmother much
harsh treatment. He became apprenticed to a book-binder when a mere
lad, and the cruel treatment received at the hands of his employer
failed to change the bent of his inclinations. He had a passion for the
stage which he gratified by striking an attitude and reciting in tragic
style with dramatic effect any occurrence which attracted his attention
to the infinite amusement of boys, and pedestrians on the street
would stop to listen to his native eloquence and behold his crude
dramatic gestures. We find him in Switzerland in 1867, endeavoring to
establish anarchy with a zeal worthy of a better cause. We next find
him in Vienna where in one of his scathing speeches he characterized
Liberalism as a swindle; the priests as deceivers. For this speech he
received a jail sentence of four weeks. Shortly after his release,
he was again sentenced to five years&rsquo; imprisonment for high
treason. However, after having served six months of the term, through
some ministerial change, he was released. A half an hour later he was
again on the platform firing hot shot and shell into the ranks of the
government with all the force of his burning invective. His ability to
sway the masses alarmed the new government, and they took measures to
have him banished. He went to Chemnitz where he became popular as an
agitator, and successful in establishing his doctrine of anarchy as the
gospel of blood, for which he was incarcerated temporarily in the red
tower, a very unpopular jail. September 3, 1872, while returning

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">Pg&nbsp;248</a></span>

from Mayence, where he had attended a socialistic congress, he was
again arrested, and a few days later was sentenced to eight months in
prison. In 1874, for some expressions used in favor of the commune of
Paris, although a member of Parliament, he was given eighteen months
in the German <del>bastile</del><ins>Bastille</ins>. At the expiration
of his sentence he became identified with the Berlin <cite>Free
Press</cite>, and for his freedom of speech he was again sentenced
to six months in jail, having served his sentence he crossed out of
his native land to London where he took charge of the new journal,
the <cite>Freiheit</cite>, and while occupying this position he
received a pressing invitation to come to Chicago and take charge of
the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>, which he declined, believing as
he did that the era of the mad misrule of anarchy was on the eve of
being inaugurated. He visited Paris, and during his stay directed a
speech full of burning hatred against the German Emperor, for which
he was accorded two years in jail. On his release he hastened to
put the channel between him and that hated country. In 1880 he was
again in Switzerland, scattering the seeds of anarchy, and forging
thunderbolts for his enemies, and many of his publications found their
way throughout the length and breadth of Europe.</p>

<p>In one of his effusions he said:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;Science has put in our possession instruments with
   which beasts of society may be removed. Princes, ministers,
   statesmen, bishops, prelates and other officials, civil
   and clerical, journalists and lawyers, representatives of
   the aristocracy and middle classes, must have their heads
   broken.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Alexander II. of Russia was murdered, &ldquo;Triumph!
triumph!&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;the monster has been executed,&rdquo; etc., and
yet this &ldquo;monster&rdquo; (?) was the man who had struck the manacles

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">Pg&nbsp;249</a></span>

from the feet of Russia&rsquo;s serfs; had lifted millions of a
degraded people to citizenship. His outburst on this occasion
gained him sixteen months in an English prison. In December
of 1882 he was en route for New York, where he met with a
most enthusiastic reception.</p>

<p>The anarchists have now eleven regular organs in circulation.
Five of these appear in English, five in German, and one
in the French language. A few extracts we herein embody will
serve to demonstrate the savage nature of these agitators. He
says:</p>

<blockquote>
   <p>&ldquo;If each member of the anarchist party some fine morning
   would seek out some hated tyrant and pick a quarrel; if only
   each man would carry a private supply of some destructive
   agency in his pocket and would either stab, poison, or with
   powder, lead, or dynamite do to death our enemies, wherever
   found, in house, office, bureau, shop, or factory; if that
   could only be done in fifty places at the same moment; if
   fires could only be started in fifty different places at the
   same time; if only special parties detailed for the purpose
   would cut the telephone and telegraph wires&mdash;must not a
   general panic result? Would not society be wild with fright?
   And would not the rabble as if by magic be inflamed with
   revolutionary passion?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can anything be more diabolical? But Most&rsquo;s paper, from
which I have quoted, is mild compared with the <cite>Rebell</cite>. This
sheet is the organ of Peukert. At present both papers vie with
each other in disseminating anarchism among the farming population.
In 1884 Most said: &ldquo;To find a way for getting
$100,000,000 would do the cause more good than to dash the
brains out of ten kings. Gold&mdash;money&mdash;is wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay hold where and when you can,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;The

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">Pg&nbsp;250</a></span>

less noise you make in laying and carrying out your plans the
less danger and the better success. The revolver is good in
extreme cases, dynamite in great movements, but, generally
speaking, the dagger and poison are the best means of propagation.
Yes, tremble, ye canaille, ye bloodsuckers, ye ravishers <ins>of</ins>
maidens, murderers, and hangmen, the day of reckoning and
revenge is near. The fight has begun along the picket line.
A girdle of dynamite encircles the world, not only the <em>old</em> but
the <em>new</em>. The bloody band of tyrants are dancing on the surface
of a volcano. There is dynamite in England, France, Germany,
Russia, Italy, Spain, New York, and Canada. It will be hot on
the day of action, and yet the brood will shudder in the sight
of death and gnash their teeth. Set fire to the houses, put
poison in all kinds of food, put poisoned nails on the chairs
occupied by our enemies, dig mines and fill them with explosives,
whet your daggers, load your revolvers, cap them, fill bombs and
have them ready. Hurl the priest from the altar; shoot him
down! Let each prince find a Brutus by his throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The foregoing language is calculated to tend toward subversion
of law and justice, and is revolutionary and treasonable in
its nature, teachings of this nature from Reinsdorf and Most,
are the direct cause of our Haymarket massacre. The authorities
are responsible largely for the commission of crime which
they may prevent even by resorting to extreme measures in
enforcing the law. While we desire peace in all our borders,
yet we believe that transgressors of the law should be made to
feel that &ldquo;God reigns, and the government at Washington
still lives.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>AUGUST SPIES.</h3>

<p>August Vincent Theodore Spies was born in Landeck, Hesse in 1855.
His father was a ranger. Spies came to America in 1872, and to Chicago
in 1873, where for a number of years he worked as an upholsterer.
He first became interested in socialistic theories in 1875, and two
years later joined the socialistic labor party, and the Lehr und
Wehr <del>v</del><ins>V</ins>erein. He became connected with the
<cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite> in 1880. He succeeded Paul Grottkau as
editor-in-chief in 1884. From that time onward he was looked up to
as one of the ablest and most influential anarchist leaders. He was
educated by a private tutor during his early boyhood days. He afterward
studied at a Polytechnic institute.</p>

<h3>ALBERT PARSONS.</h3>

<p>Albert R. Parsons was born in Montgomery, Ala., in 1848.
His parents died when he was young, and his rearing fell to the
lot of his elder brother, W. R. Parsons, who was a general in
the Confederate army. In 1855 he removed to Johnson county,
Texas, taking Albert with him. The latter received some

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">Pg&nbsp;252</a></span>

schooling at Waco, and subsequently became a printer on the Galveston
<cite>News</cite>. When the war broke out he ran away from home and
became a &ldquo;powder monkey&rdquo; in a company of confederate
artillery. Subsequently he served successively under the command of
his brothers, Richard and William H. Parsons. After the war he edited
the <cite>Spectator</cite>, a weekly paper, at Waco. Much to the
disgust of his brothers, he became a Republican, and something of a
politician. As such he held one or two subordinate federal offices at
Austin, and at one time was secretary of the State Senate. Coming to
Chicago he worked for a time in various printing offices, and then
became a professional labor agitator. He was at one time Master Workman
of District Assembly 24, Knights of Labor, and president of the Trades
Assembly for three years. In 1879 he was nominated by the Socialistic
Labor party as a candidate for their President of the United States,
but declined, as he was not then thirty-five years old. In 1883, at
<del>Pittsburg</del><ins>Pittsburgh</ins>, he helped to frame the
platform of the International Working People&rsquo;s Association. He
was put forward by the socialists as a candidate for city clerk in
1883. He became editor of the <cite>Alarm</cite>, the organ of the
&ldquo;American group&rdquo; of anarchists in Chicago in 1884, which
position he held up to the time of the Haymarket riot in May 1886, but
on the morning following the explosion, A. R. Parsons was not found
in his accustomed place as editor of the <cite>Alarm</cite>. He had
decamped, but many believed he was hiding in Chicago, as on the evening
of the 7th of May a letter posted in Chicago at 7:30 was received by
the editor of the <cite>Daily News</cite>, which ran thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mr. M. E. Stone, Editor Daily News</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
     <p>&ldquo;DEAR SIR&mdash;I want to speak a word through you to my
     fellow-workers, just to let them know that I am still in the
     land of

     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">Pg&nbsp;253</a></span>

     the living and looking out for their interests.</p>

     <p>&ldquo;And further, give a few hints to some of the fellows who
     desire to live on anarchists, that may be for their welfare.
     In the first place, I am watching the papers and also the
     knowing chaps who give the pointers as to my whereabouts, some
     of whom will make good subjects for the coroner&rsquo;s inquest one
     of these days should they persist in their present course. To
     the public I desire to say that the devil is never so black
     as you can paint him. I will in due time turn up and answer
     for myself for anything I may have said or done. I have no
     regrets for past conduct and no pledges for the future if
     there is to be nothing but blood and death for the toilers
     of America. Whenever the public decide to use reason and
     justice in dealing with the producing class, just at that
     time will you see me. But, should the decision be to continue
     the present course of death and slavery just so long will I
     wage relentless war on all organized force, and all endeavor
     to find me will be fruitless. Watching my wife and her kind
     friends is of no use. I am dead to them already. I count my
     life already sacrificed for daring to stand between tyrants
     and slaves.</p>

     <p>&ldquo;To show you how well I am kept posted, I know who was
     sent to La Grange for me to-day. I was not there. I know
     who put you on the track of Glasgow, and just where to find
     him. Just say to that man for me that his day of reckoning
     will come soon. I read all the papers to-day, and will see
     the <cite>Times</cite>, <cite>Inter-Ocean</cite>, and Hesing
     later.</p>

     <p>&ldquo;Now, as to what must be done to satisfy the anarchists
     is to stop all these demands for blood and show a spirit of
     reason and a disposition to put down the oppressors of the
     people, and enforce laws against rich thieves as readily as
     you do against

     <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">Pg&nbsp;254</a></span>

     the poor. Grant every fair demand of labor. Give those poor
     creatures enough to satisfy their hunger, and I will guarantee
     a quiet period in which all the great questions of land and
     wages, and rights can be put in operation without further
     bloodshed. But if not, I am already sacrificed as a martyr for
     the cause. I have thousands of brethren who will sell their
     lives just as dearly as I will mine, and at just as great cost
     to our enemies.</p>

     <p>&ldquo;I shall wait as long as I think necessary for the public
     to take warning, and then you decide your own fate.</p>

     <p>&ldquo;It must be LIBERTY for the people or DEATH for
     CAPITALISTS. I am not choosing more. It is your choice and
     your last. I love humanity, and therefore die for it. No one
     can do more. Every drop of my blood shall count an avenger,
     and woe to America when these are in arms.</p>

     <p>&ldquo;I have not slept, nor shall I sleep until I sleep the
     sleep of death, or my fellow men are on the road to LIBERTY.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="quotsig">&ldquo;A. R. PARSONS.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>SAMUEL FIELDEN.</h3>

<p>Samuel Fielden was born in Todmorden, Lancashire, England,
in 1847, and spent thirteen years of his boyhood working
in a cotton mill. In early manhood he became a Methodist minister
and Sunday-school superintendent in his native place. In
1868 he came to New York, worked for a few months in a cotton
mill, and in the following year came to Chicago. For the
greater portion of the time since he has worked as a laborer.
He joined the liberal league in 1880, where he met Spies and
Parsons. He became a socialist in 1883, and has spent much
time as a traveling agitator of the International Working People&rsquo;s
association.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">Pg&nbsp;255</a></span></p>

<p>We feel sure that Samuel Fielden is to-day serving out a life
sentence as the result of forming associations through which he
was led to mingle with agitators anarchistic, whose teachings
were treasonable. Though not endowed by nature with proclivities
whose tendencies were toward violence and bloodshed, yet being
full of vanity and of a vacillating nature was led to make
speeches of an incendiary and revolutionary character which
<del>indentified</del><ins>identified</ins> him with those responsible
for the result of the fatal bomb, and doomed him to a life of
unrequited toil and of penal servitude.</p>

<h3>ADOLPH FISCHER.</h3>

<p>Adolph Fischer, who was about thirty years old, came to this country
from Germany when a boy, and learned the printer&rsquo;s trade with his
brother, who was editor of a German weekly at Nashville, Tenn. For
several years Fischer was editor and proprietor of the Little Rock
(Ark.) <cite>Staats Zeitung</cite>. This he sold in 1881, after which
he worked at his trade in St. Louis and Chicago. After coming to
Chicago he became a most rabid anarchist, and often accused Spies and
Schwab of being half-hearted, and of not having the courage to express
their convictions. He, like Engel, believed they were not radical
enough. At one time he, with Engel and Fehling, started <cite>De
Anarchist</cite>, a fire-eating weekly, designed to supplant the
<cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>.</p>

<p>He entered with all his possible energy into the spirit of
socialism and anarchy, so much so, that it became his only theme
and the source of happiness to him which he fully expressed in
his last words upon the gallows, viz: &ldquo;This is the happiest
moment of my life.&rdquo; If that were the case, what an unendurable
life were his, and the prospect of dissolution offered a rest

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">Pg&nbsp;256</a></span>

from the self-inflicted torment of continuing to live.</p>

<h3>GEORGE ENGEL.</h3>

<p>George Engel was born in Cassel, Germany, in 1836. He
received a common school education and learned the printer&rsquo;s
trade. He came to America in 1873, and a year later to Chicago,
where he became a convert to socialism, and later a rabid
anarchist. He founded the famous &ldquo;Northwest group&rdquo; in 1883.</p>

<p>He spoke English very imperfectly, and with great difficulty,
he manifested no desire to make progress in anything except in
anarchy. The sinister expression of his countenance indicated
a dogged stubborn and cruel nature, full of malice and hatred
which led him to use this latest breath in a &ldquo;hurrah for
anarchy&rdquo; upon the gallows. Such men behold nothing beautiful
in nature, nor anything to admire in well organized society,
under the mad misrule of anarchy controlled by such an element,
society would soon lapse back to the days of primitive barbarism
and superstition.</p>

<h3>MICHAEL SCHWAB.</h3>

<p>Michael Schwab was born near Mannheim, Germany, in 1853,
and was educated in a convent. For several years he worked
at the book-binding trade in various cities. He came to America
in 1879.</p>

<p>He was a co-adjutor with August Spies in connection with
the <cite>Arbeiter Zeitung</cite>. He was a pronounced socialist, though of
a milder type than Spies, Parsons or Fischer. He was vacillating
in his nature, and not calculated for a leader, but capable
of being led. Had he chosen for his companions loyal and
patriotic associates, he doubtless would have become a trusted

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">Pg&nbsp;257</a></span>

citizen and a champion of American institutions instead of a
propagator of anarchy which cost him the price of his liberty.</p>

<h3>AUTOBIOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p>Oscar W. Neebe was born in New York city on the 12th day
of July in the year 1850. His parents were German, and in
order to give their children an education in German they
removed from New York to Germany when Oscar was but a
child. His boyhood and school days were spent in Hesse Cassel.
But at the age of fourteen years he returned to New York
and as he expresses himself, was glad to set foot once more upon
the land of the free, where all men were equal regardless of
color or nationality, for the war had just closed which had
stricken the chains and festering fetters from the limbs of the
African slave, which meant the unbarring of the dungeon of
the mind, giving them the right to acquire an education which
before was denied them, and making them heir to the inalienable
rights of citizenship. He says &ldquo;I saw the sun-browned soldiers
of the federal army returning from the South where they had
fought for liberty and freedom, and learned to love them as
brothers when I heard them say: &lsquo;There is now no more
slavery.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Catching the inspiration of these words of Horace Greely:
&ldquo;Go West young man,&rdquo; he accordingly came to Chicago at the
age of sixteen years, but returned to New York again where he
learned the trade of tinsmith and cornice-maker. But New
York, with all its fascinations, failed to constitute him contented
and happy, and in February, 1877, we find him again in Chicago
where he commenced work for the Adams and Westlake Manufacturing
Company. He states that he was discharged July 1,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">Pg&nbsp;258</a></span>

for daring to champion the working man, and at times was
reduced to poverty and almost starvation because of his avowed
proclivities as an agitator.</p>

<p>He had become identified with the socialistic agitators in
1877, and the active part and interest manifested by him in the
socialists was largely responsible for his lack of success in
obtaining and holding a situation. In 1878 he obtained a situation
as salesman for the Riversdale Distillery Company, selling
their compressed yeast.</p>

<p>His financial embarrassment threw him largely among the
agitators of the Labor party, and in 1886, after the Haymarket
riot, he was arrested and tried for murder or for complicity in
the conspiracy which led to the massacre for which he received
a sentence of fifteen years in the penitentiary.</p>

<h3>LOUIS LINGG,</h3>

<p>was only twenty-one years old, and was the youngest of the doomed
anarchists. He was born in Baden, Germany, in 1864. He secured a
common school education in Germany. He left his native country
when very young and went to Switzerland where he remained several
years. He came to America in 1885, working at the carpenter trade,
at the same time availing himself of every opportunity for the
development of his anarchistic proclivities, which seemed to be
<del>heighth</del><ins>height</ins> of his ambition. He wrote his
autobiography after having received the death sentence, which we
decline to publish in consequence of its rabid and treasonable type
of anarchy, sufficient in itself to prove his complicity in the foul
conspiracy. He was one of the most arch plotters of dark and tragic
history.</p>

</div>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL RECORD</h3>

<p>of John Bonfield, Esq., inspector and secretary of Police Department.</p>

<p>He was born in the year 1836, at Bathurst, New Brunswick.
His father was a thriving farmer, but in order to give his children
the advantages of superior facilities for education, removed
to Buffalo, N. Y., in 1842, and in 1844 he came with his family
to Chicago.</p>

<p>John Bonfield, after finishing his education, and by his
natural talent and shrewdness having obtained a large stock of
general knowledge from the ordinary pursuits of life in which
he had engaged, became identified with the police force of Chicago
in the year 1878 as patrolman. But he was destined to
occupy a subordinate position for only a brief period, as in 1879
he was placed upon the staff of detectives.</p>

<p>His true nobility of character, noble bearing, and faithful
discharge of his duties won for him the confidence of all, and in 1880
he gained one more step in the golden ladder of fame, being raised to
the rank of lieutenant. He was next appointed captain of the Third
<del>precint</del><ins>precinct</ins>, and in 1885 was made inspector
of the entire police force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">Pg&nbsp;260</a></span></p>

<p>Owing to the brave and gallant bearing of Inspector Bonfield
in relation to the faithful discharge of his every duty during
his past career, (thereby winning the confidence of superior
officers relative to his ability,) he was entrusted with the entire
command of the detachment who so bravely on the night of
May 4, 1886, turned back the tide of anarchy which threatened
to sweep like a tidal wave over the fairest heritage upon God&rsquo;s
green earth, scattering death and debris all along its terrible
track. Truly if brave deeds and noble acts, and honesty of
purpose, coupled with patriotism are worthy of note, the name
of John Bonfield and the brave officers under his command on
that terrible night of the Haymarket massacre, shall live forever
upon the brightest page of the historian.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<h3>CANUTE R. MATSON,</h3>

<p>was born in Norway in the year 1843. He emigrated with his
parents to America in 1848, and settled in Walworth county,
Wisconsin, but removed in a short time to Dane county, Wisconsin,
where in 1858 he entered Albion Academy, and as a
natural sequence of his insatiate thirst for knowledge he made
rapid progress maintaining ever a prominent place at the head of
his class. He was a student in Milton College at the opening of
the war. The inherent patriotism of a noble nature had been
fanned into a flame by the institutions of American freedom,
and he at once offered himself as a sacrifice, if need be, in the
defense of his adopted country, by enlisting in 1861 in the
Union army as a private soldier in Company K, Thirteenth Wisconsin
Infantry. In 1862 he was made commissary sergeant.
He was raised to lieutenant of Company G., in 1864, and was
acting regimental quartermaster at the close of the war in 1865,
and received his honorable discharge bearing the untarnished
reputation of a brave soldier and a noble officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">Pg&nbsp;261</a></span></p>

<p>He afterward obtained a position in the post office where he
published the <cite>Postal Record</cite>, an official paper of the
department.</p>

<p>In 1868 he was elected clerk of the Police Court. In 1871 he
was accorded the power to appoint, and also the supervision of
the deputies. In 1875 he was appointed justice of the peace.
In 1878 he was admitted to the bar. He ran for sheriff in 1879
and was only defeated by a very small majority in favor of his
opponent. He served two years as coroner, being nominated by
<del>acclammation</del><ins>acclamation</ins> when he satisfied all
parties of his intent, and ability to perform the duties of his office
with credit to himself and honor to those by whose effort he had been
placed in so responsible a position.</p>

<p>In 1882 he was again a candidate for the office of sheriff
through the importunities of his friends, and was barely
defeated by S. F. Hanchett, who in selecting a chief deputy
made the wise choice of C. R. Matson, which position he filled
to the close of the term, giving entire satisfaction to all parties
with whom he came in contact in connection with the discharge
of his official duties.</p>

<p>He has obtained all the honorable and responsible positions
which he has filled solely upon his merits, and has retained them
with the confidence of the public, by the efficient and impartial
manner in which he has served the people of Cook county.</p>

<p>He was installed in the office of sheriff of Cook county Dec.
6, 1886, enjoying still the confidence of the people. He is a
man of great heart, broad and deep sympathies, yet unswerving
in the administration of the law as a sacred obligation he
owes to the public, and in the years to come history replete with

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">Pg&nbsp;262</a></span>

the sayings and doings of the great men of to-day will shed a
halo of glory forever upon the name of Canute R. Matson as a
brave, true and noble man, and the most prominent Scandinavian
leader of the era in which he lived, having left an example
worthy of emulation by those who shall come after him.</p>

<h3>JOSEPH E. GARY,</h3>

<p>the presiding judge at the trial of the anarchists, was born at
Potsdam, New York, July 9, 1821, at which place he received a
common school education where he also spent his early boyhood
days until 1843, when he went to St. Louis, Mo., and read law,
opening his first law office at Springfield, Mo. But in 1849 he
removed to Las Vegas, N. M., where he learned to write well
and speak fluently the Spanish language. He removed to San
Francisco, Cal., where he practiced his chosen profession until
1856, when he returned to Chicago and formed a co-partnership
with Murray F. Tuley, now Judge Tuley of the bench. He
finally became a law partner with E. and A. Van Buren, which
continued until 1863, when he was elected to the bench. His
judicial mind and clear comprehensive sense of right places him
high among his compeers as a celebrity upon the technicalities
of law. He is esteemed by all who know him.</p>

<h3>JULIUS S. GRINNELL,</h3>

<p>was born at Massena, St. Lawrence county, New York, in 1842.
He is of French-Welsh extraction, but it is not of his illustrious
ancestors we wish to speak in this sketch. Suffice it to say that
the Grinnell family are among the oldest and best families of the
Eastern and New England States. Julius S. Grinnell graduated
in the office of the Hon. William C. Brown in Ogdensburg, N.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">Pg&nbsp;263</a></span>

Y., in 1868. He came to Chicago in 1870 where he commenced
to struggle manfully toward the summit of fame. His eloquence
and oratory, along with the comprehensive grasp of a most
extraordinary mind has made his ascent rapid and sure. His
high aims and lofty aspirations have in early life been rewarded.
He can exclaim &ldquo;Eureka,&rdquo; as at the age of forty-six years he
has been elected to the bench.</p>

<h3>CAPTAIN SCHAACK,</h3>

<p>of the Fifth precinct is deserving of great credit, not merely for
the assiduity with which he applied himself to the fatiguing
duties of unraveling the mysteries of anarchy in secret organization,
but also for the tact and shrewdness coupled with the
fearless manner in which he discharged the dangerous duties
incident to his office during the reign of terror which succeeded
the Haymarket tragedy. It is a well known fact that Captain
Schaack was one of the most energetic workers, as well as one
of the principal factors in ferreting out and dragging to justice
the dangerous element of socialism and anarchy in the great
conspiracy. Chicago is indebted to Captain Schaack for a large
majority of the evidence which resulted in the conviction, condemnation,
and execution of these lawless men whose object and
aim was to sow the seeds of discord and confusion in the refined
and well organized circles of society. The low-browed class of
ignorant men who stood around their leaders and in discordant
voices howled their praise, were, under this leadership capable
of the wildest onset, or the dark and patient vigil, of him who
treasures up in heart of hatred an imaginary wrong. Every
step taken by Captain Schaack and his faithful band of tried
men was full of dangers. Over fifty bombs had been made

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">Pg&nbsp;264</a></span>

and distributed throughout the city. One had fallen with deadly
effect, and any moment another might be expected to scatter
death and debris among the ranks of faithful officers, who when
detailed for service knew not but they were being led as sheep
to the slaughter.</p>

<p>In the ages to come when as a record of history this anarchistic
conspiracy of 1886 is referred to, the bold acts of noble
daring, the skill, bravery and self-sacrificing spirit of Captain
Schaack in the suppression of anarchy will be remembered by
a grateful people as a monument to immortalize his name.</p>

<h3>EULOGIZING THE POLICE.</h3>

<p>What peace-loving citizen of Chicago desiring her commercial
prosperity and the perpetuity of American institutions, with
all it means of home and protection for free-born American citizens
to behold our starry banner still proudly floating from the
citadel of the most free country upon God&rsquo;s green earth, but
will with me thank God for the blessings of peace secured to us
by the prompt and steady action of our brave and noble police
on the night of May 4, 1886. When forgetful of their own personal
safety in their devotion to the cause of liberty, over the prostrate
forms of mangled and dying comrades they charged this
treacherous band of alien outlaws, beating down the red hand
of anarchy which was reaching out its tentacles to usurp the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">Pg&nbsp;265</a></span>

birthright of this nation bequeathed to it by our ancestors and
made sacred to every loyal heart by a baptism of the blood of
our sires and grandsires in 1776.</p>

<p>Not one ray of light from one single star upon our grand old
flag shall ever tarnish its glory or dim its radiance in the shadow
of the crimson flag of anarchy.</p>

<p>With reference to that terrible night who will not with me
adopt the following language:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When can their glory fade?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was to us a blood fought victory, and every officer who
poured out his life on that eventful night is deserving of a
monument in the hearts of a grateful people and a prominent
place among the wreath-crowned martyrs in the cause of liberty.
Chicago&rsquo;s entire force who respond so promptly to a call, discharging
their duty so faithfully, are worthy the name of heroes
as justly as those who have spilled rivers of blood upon the
ensanguined field of Marathon or Waterloo.</p>

<p>What matters it now to Officer Degan and his slaughtered
comrades that &ldquo;boldly they fought and well.&rdquo; Their widowed
wives and orphan children tell the price they paid for the blessings
of peace we to-day enjoy.</p>

<p>The maimed and suffering officers we daily behold as the
result of that direful night speak plainly of what it cost them
in the protection of our blood-bought privileges of 1776.</p>

<p>Verily, a monument of marble should be erected to their
memory upon the spot where they fell, bearing the names of that
gallant band who so bravely turned back the incoming tide,
whose black and seething waters threatened to wreck the foundations
of our social, civil and national institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">Pg&nbsp;266</a></span></p>

<h3>CAPITAL AND LABOR.</h3>

<p>Two young men from the same flourishing little town, and
bosom friends graduate from the same school, each with aspirations
lofty as the pinnacle of fame. Each one chooses an art
or craft, or profession. Each man has the same chance to succeed.
The avenues of trade and commerce are open alike to
all. One of these young men well knowing that there is no
royal road to wealth and fame, and that his success depends
solely upon his economy and industry, wisely adopts a code of
laws by which his life is to be regulated and governed, and his
future of success or failure determined. He remembers that his
preceptor once remarked to him thus: &ldquo;Raymond, remember
this: If you ever expect to become wealthy, spend each day less
than you earn,&rdquo; and he had adopted it. He husbanded each
week, and month, and year a portion of his earnings; years pass
on and his coffers are filling with that yellow god which sways
the destinies of men and empires. He engages in manufacturing
enterprises or mercantile pursuits, and his happiness is complete
in his palatial home, with a lovely wife and children as a keystone
crowning the arch which spans the dark and turbid stream
of life.</p>

<p>Let us follow the other young man who started in the race
at the same time and under the same auspicious circumstances.
He has taken a different course. He has not been idle but a
spendthrift, working during the week earning money to spend
among his boon companions during Sunday, and is always in
debt and trouble as he is spending more than he earns. He has
availed himself of the privilege of rejoicing in the days of his
youth, walking in the ways of his heart and the sight of his

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">Pg&nbsp;267</a></span>

eyes, forgetting that for all these things he will be brought into
judgment, as no law of our physical nature or social standing
can be violated with impunity, there is no appeal from the self-inflicted
punishment of an accusing conscience for extreme
prodigality and reckless expenditure in riotous living. To-night
he is standing upon the corner of the street shivering under the
biting blast which is sifting the early snow of winter amid his
prematurely grizzled hair. He is not at peace with himself or
the world. He hates himself for being poor and others for
being rich. At this juncture the elegantly equipped carriage of
his former classmate rolls past. Its owner is now a millionaire
by earnest, honest and persevering endeavor. He is a homeless
pauper and the self-constituted architect of his own misfortunes,
yet he is willing to offer himself as a representative of the terrible
contrast between capital and labor.</p>

<h3>THE ANARCHIST&rsquo;S FATAL DELUSION.</h3>

<p>Under the fascination of rose-tinted delusion whose fatal
mists obscure the mental and moral realm of thought, many
become criminals, goaded on by blind infatuation which persevered
in becomes a passion all-absorbing in its nature. In the
blindness of their infatuation they seek to immortalize their
names by a bold and base attempt at the subversion of law and
order.</p>

<p>Having by the mad misrule of anarchy rendered themselves
amenable to law, and by crime forfeited not only their liberty
but their lives, they stubbornly refuse to ask for executive
clemency, choosing death in the error of their ways, and in the
language of Patrick Henry demanding unconditional &ldquo;liberty or
death.&rdquo; These anarchists under the delusion that they were

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">Pg&nbsp;268</a></span>

becoming martyrs, courted death, and from the gallows raised
a defiant shout for the perpetuity and progress of anarchy which
they fondly hoped would go ringing down the corridors of time,
increased by tributaries until anarchy as a mighty torrent should
bear away law, order and civilization by the fury of its resistless
force, until bombs, dynamite and treason should triumph. Under
the sophistry and insidious teachings of the nefarious Herr
Most, anarchy developed rapidly in Chicago, and his minions
were willing to offer up wives and children, liberty, even life if
necessary, in the interest of the cause they had espoused. They
raised their voice publicly in denouncing imaginary wrongs and
the plaudits of the admiring ignorant lower classes amounted
to an inspiration to them which urged them on to openly advocate
deeds of violence and blood. Herr Most has stated that
the gibbet upon which these anarchist murderers paid the penalty
for their crimes will in the ages to come be looked upon
with the same veneration that the cross is by the Christian.</p>

<p>Now, that the majesty of the law has been maintained in
their execution, their sympathizing followers seek to erect a monument
to perpetuate their memory, the most fitting tablet over
their grave should be, &ldquo;Here lies anarchy in her shameful
tomb.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! Torquemada, from thy fiery jail,&rdquo; and thou
&ldquo;George Jeffries, from underneath the altar which seeks with
Christian charity to hide thy hated bones,&rdquo; with the long line
of hideous cruel monsters from the dead, come and compare thy
deeds in contrast with thy lesser light and knowledge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come seek thy equals here.&rdquo;</p>
